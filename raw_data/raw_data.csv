14,"The Nuggets continued their domination of the Thunder in their first meeting back on Dec. 14, winning 110-102 for their seventh consecutive victory in the rivalry. Additionally, the Nuggets have played great against division foes, going 9-0 vs. Northwest Division clubs, averaging a 9.6 margin of victory. For all the love Denver receives as a home team, it should get more praise for having the fifth-highest winning percentage in road games. What jumped out at me and makes me confident in betting the NUGGETS (+100) to win outright is the edge they have in Per 100 Possession categories. Both teams are having a great season, but Denver is ranked seventh in offensive rating and 10th in defensive rating; Oklahoma City is 14th in offensive rating and 12th in defensive rating. ",7

17,"The last two Nuggets-Thunder meetings went Under the projected total and the Nuggets have a 2-7 O/U record in games against division opponents. Their combined O/U record is 52-57-1 so the game is most likely to go Under. Also, these teams have played a combined three games with four or more rest days and the O/U record is 0-3 in those games. I lean UNDER 216.5 (-115).",10

83,OKC face their divisional rivals at home to start the home stretch.,2
84,"Oklahoma City starts the final portion of the season with a tough game against the Denver Nuggets. The Nuggets are one of the few teams who are legitimately fighting for a deep play-off run and the possibility of winning an NBA title. Denver is stingy defensively and will make life difficult for the Thunder, so it is imperative that the offense works to its fullest. ",3
85,A victory against the Nuggets would be a significant season win. There has been a lot of chatter about the Thunder not having a chance in the play-offs — this is the type of game where OKC can prove that they are no push-overs. ,4
86,The game starts at 8:00 (EST) and will be broadcast on ESPN.,5
87,"Despite Oklahoma City having mixed results coming into the All-Star break, the offense in the games prior was impressive. From the eye test, it did not seem like Oklahoma City were doing anything special on that end of the floor, but the numbers paint a different picture.",6
88,"OKC’s offensive rating over the last ten games stands at 115.8, which would rank the Thunder as fifth in the league. This rating is exceptional and it largely stems from the entire team developing a really good comfort level on the court. Four of the starters have played with each other for more than fifty games, developing a chemistry with the Thunder thinking as one brain on the court. ",7
89,"While this offensive efficiency is hugely impressive, I still think that OKC can improve even further by tweaking the offensive scheming on offense. Oklahoma City had a lot of success early in the season by going to Adams in hand-off situations and letting the Kiwi pick out passes. Although hand-offs have become more common in a league where spacing is prioritised, it is still a difficult coverage to defend. The opposing big man may not be confident stepping out towards the perimeter and is forced to defend in an uncomfortable situation which is the ideal situation for the Thunder.",8
90,"Oklahoma City has been proficient from mid-range and a lot of the offense has materialised from this area of the floor. It has been common for Chris Paul to drop into this zone and take elbow jumpers, as has been true for Dennis Schroder. ",9
91,"Against Denver, this is an area which can exploited due to the Nuggets’ defensive scheming. Denver, like most teams in the league, scheme so that the least efficient shot is sacrificed. In practice, this means that the three-point shot and the layup are defended really tightly while the mid-range is defended loosely. Oklahoma City are not like most other teams in the league, they have at least two players who can cook from this area and can punish Denver’s tactical decisions. One Thunder player getting hot from the mid-range area will cause Denver’s scheming to be adjusted on the fly which will create open opportunities elsewhere. Looking further ahead to the play-offs, it is valuable for the Thunder to have guys who can knock down looks from mid-range because the game changes. ",10
92,"Defences key in and take away good looks; you need players who can score effectively on ‘bad looks’. The best example of the mid-range’s value was last season in the Eastern Conference Semi-Finals, Kawhi Leonard carried the Raptors’ offence when Philly had taken away easy shots. ",11
93,"Oklahoma City ran a lot of post-up situations for Russell Westbrook last season and it was one of the few efficient looks which Westbrook managed to generate. The post-up worked for Russ because he was too strong and too fast for the defense to stop. The same evolution occurred in Houston, Mike D’Antoni had experimented with the post-up in regards to Chris Paul. D’Antoni looked at using this action as a way of masking Paul’s inability to create separation from the defender, it slowed the game down and gave him an opportunity to beat his man using his intelligence and ball-handling skills. ",12
94,"For the Thunder, Paul has not posted up all season, but it could be an interesting wrinkle for Donovan to add to the offense. Paul is a smaller guard but he is powerfully built in the lower body which allows him to bump defenders and create space to get a layup off. Paul is also comfortable shooting fadeaways out of this situation which adds another variation to this particular play. ",13
95,"Jerami Grant will return to Oklahoma City for the first time since his trade in the summer. Grant spent three seasons with the Thunder in which he developed from a hyper-athlete to a forward who was defensively versatile. Grant has settled nicely into a bench role for Nuggets as another rangy, mobile defender who can be relied upon to space the floor effectively.",14
96,Michael Porter Jr was taken by the Nuggets at the end of the lottery by the Nuggets in 2018. There were huge concerns about Porter’s injury history and whether he could have a strong career at the NBA level. MPJ was expected to be a top five pick before his injury but the concerns caused him to slide down the draft boards into the perfect situation. ,15
97,"Denver already had more than enough wing talent, which allowed Porter to develop slowly and get healthy. He has emerged this season as an important part of the Nuggets’ rotation, he is a big wing to score the ball effectively while being able to cover multiple positions on defence. This has been a weakness in the Nuggets’ roster for a few seasons especially when it comes to defending guys like Paul George, LeBron James or Kevin Durant. The match-up on defense was often Will Barton defending taller, stronger players which was difficult for Denver to manage. Porter’s emergence gives them the length to defend bigger wings.",16
98,"I know that the All-Star game has passed, but I feel like I have to talk about the ending of the game. It was exceptional in my opinion — that final quarter felt like a play-off game with how hard that the players were playing. The most surprising aspect of the game was that defense was actually being played instead of the usual layup line that this game turns into. Kyle Lowry took two charges. When was the last time that this happened in an exhibition game? ",17
99,"The Elam Ending is an innovative idea and I expect the league to look at this idea in more detail. It is common knowledge that Adam Silver would like to have a mid-season tournament like other sports around the league. In football (soccer), most leagues will have a domestic mid-season tournament. In the Bundesliga, the tournament is called the DFB-Pokal trophy. As a football fan, I like this concept but it has to be executed correctly. Early competition rounds can be a little boring and I could see the Elam Ending being used to ensure exciting games throughout the competition.",18

103,"OKLAHOMA CITY -- Before training camp, as nine new Oklahoma City Thunder players were getting to know one another while the organization itself was recalibrating to a post-Russell Westbrook world, coach Billy Donovan sat down with the three point guards on the roster and presented a bold plan.",1
104,"They -- being Chris Paul, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Dennis Schroder -- are three of Donovan's five best players. And he needed to find a way to play them all as much as possible, which would probably include playing all three of them together.",2
105,Paul is listed at 6-foot-1. Schroder is a generous 6-1. And Gilgeous-Alexander is the giant of the group at 6-5. None of the three is listed at more than 180 pounds. They're all playmakers. They're all scorers. They all thrive with the ball in their hands.,3
106,"""If we moved it, if we shared it and if we played together, it would be really hard to guard,"" Donovan told them. He saw it simplified: Two of the three would always being playing against defenders scrambling to close out on the perimeter.",4
107,"""And you're all really good at that,"" he said.Editor's PicksLowe: Ten NBA things I like and don't like, including the fun version of CP3NBA trade grades: Winners in the Wizards-Nuggets deal1 Related",5
108,"Despite the positional and vertical challenges of it, Donovan wanted to try it. The counterlogic was obvious, and when Donovan floated the idea publicly at media day, it was met with heavy skepticism.",6
109,"""I hoped it would work,"" Paul said, leaning on the word ""hope"" pretty heavily. ""We all have different personalities -- you never know what different guys' goals are and whatnot -- but I was excited about it. The biggest thing was that Billy sat us all down. We met, us three and Billy, and talked about the possibilities of what it could be, and thankfully all of us are giving up a little bit here and there for the success of the team.""",7
110,"Now, Donovan's plan hasn't just been validated 56 games into the season, with a sparkling 34-22 record and fresh off the lineup's dismantling of the Denver Nuggets in crunch time for a 113-101 statement win on Friday. The strategy has redefined the Thunder's season -- and the possibility to hope for something more ahead.",8
111,"The Thunder are the league's undisputed clutch-time maestros, with a league-best plus-27.3 net rating in a league-high 38 games that feature a score within five points in the last five minutes of regulation. They are 25-13 in clutch-time games, with the best offense in the clutch at an absurd 123.5 points per 100 possessions. Paul leads the league in clutch scoring (128 points), Gilgeous-Alexander is 12th (79) and Schroder is 27th (62). When that trio is on the floor, OKC outscores opponents by 29.6 points per 100 possessions.",9
112,"OKC's preferred closing group -- the three guards, plus center Steven Adams and power forward Danilo Gallinari -- is the best lineup in the NBA by net rating with a minimum 150 minutes (plus-30.2 per 100 in 159 minutes). And 52.8% of those minutes have come in the fourth quarter.",10
113,"""They've all coexisted, they've all found a way to make each other better,"" Donovan said of the three guards. ""I felt like it could work, but it wouldn't have worked if those guys didn't have the attitude and mentality they had towards it. Really it was them, the way they handled it.""",11
114,"When the Thunder choose to use Chris Paul, Dennis Schroder, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Danilo Gallinari and Steven Adams together, it is usually at the end of games -- and they will beat you.",12
115,"Against the Nuggets, it was Paul's midrange mastery that took over. He snaked around screens, weaved through traffic, dribbled in, dribbled out and knocked down shots. It has become almost a formula the Thunder abide by: Get through the first three quarters, keep it close, release the point guard. It is orchestrated by Donovan playing different duo combinations throughout the game, setting up the final few minutes with the three guards finishing it.",13
116,"If the Golden State Warriors had the death lineup, the Thunder have the endgame lineup.",14
117,"""If you guys had mics on all of us, you'd get a chance to see we're all each other's biggest cheerleaders,"" Paul said. ""I've seen teams where guys aren't necessarily rooting for each other. They want you to do bad so they can be in the game. But we're not like that in here, and it's refreshing and nice to see.""",15
118,"According to ESPN Stats & Information research, the point guard trio has played 90 minutes together in clutch time and 373 minutes total -- 47.7% of the time in the fourth quarter; 42.1% of the time in the last five minutes and/or overtime; and 24.1% of the time in the clutch.",16
119,"""It's not like I'm trying to hold it to the fourth,"" Donovan said. ""I just don't want it to be at the expense where we're trying to play that way and the other portions of the game we're not as good. There's a balance you have to find.""",17
120,"The Nuggets themselves are no clutch-time slouches, either. They're 23-12 in clutch-time games, the second-most wins in the league behind Oklahoma City. They found their way to the top tier of the Western Conference with a ground-and-pound approach, playing close games and winning behind timely stops and execution.",18
121,"The Thunder wound up outscoring the Nuggets 35-24 in the fourth quarter. Denver's sloppy finish on Friday was uncharacteristic but also possibly evidence of the rhythm the Nuggets are trying to rediscover. The past two months have included games in which the first priority was to field a playable rotation and the second was to try to win with whatever was cobbled together. Friday's starting lineup of Jamal Murray, Gary Harris, Will Barton, Paul Millsap and All-Star Nikola Jokic returned in Oklahoma City intact for the first time since Jan. 6 because of injuries to everyone except Jokic.",19
122,"The Nuggets weathered the storm behind the pendulous brilliance of Jokic, who took on a more vocal leadership role during the past couple of months. In the face of the recent attrition, Denver entered Friday's game still No. 2 in the West. It might look as if moving is a chore and that he is tucking the ball into bed rather than shooting it, but Jokic is a ruthless tactician.",20
123,"""If you want to sleep on the Nuggets, if you want to sleep on Nikola, keep on sleepin',"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said of his perception at the lack of appreciation for Jokic's season. ""We're not concerned about any of that stuff. We know who we have. We have an MVP candidate; we have the best center in the NBA. And we're gonna continue to play through and rely on him to lead this team on and off the court.""ESPN Daily podcastMonday through Friday, host Mina Kimes brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet.

124,"Monday through Friday, host Mina Kimes brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen",22
125,"Jokic was his typical fantastic self, scoring 11 of Denver's first 13 points and finishing with a game-high 32 points on 12-of-15 shooting. He is averaging 20.8 points, 10.2 rebounds and 6.9 assists; but since Jan. 7, the production has cranked to 24.3 points, 10.9 rebounds and 7.8 assists.",23
126,"""He's not going to bed at night wondering why no one's not talking about him,"" Malone said. ""He doesn't care. He's reading his book on horses, we're winning games and he's happy. If he's happy, I'm happy.""",24
127,"Jokic and Malone weren't very happy after Friday's game. OKC carved the typically stout Denver defense, and if this was a preview of a possible postseason matchup, it had to give Malone some pause. Those final five minutes are when the Nuggets often do their best work, and in this case, the Thunder outscored them 18-9 in the last 5:31 of the game. With Schroder battling through a tweaked ankle, the three-guard lineup was deployed a little later than usual, but it was on the front end of putting the wraps on another win.",25
128,"The prevailing theme from the Thunder is unselfishness, but it's also about connectivity. The Thunder have had reps in crunch time, and it's obvious to everyone that Paul is good in close games. He produces winning possessions, consistently locating the best possible shot more often than not. But he doesn't monopolize. On Friday, he had his moments, but he also leaned on Gallinari, he gave the ball to Schroder to let him work a mismatch and he had Gilgeous-Alexander bring it up to initiate the offense. The plan is to let whomever is cooking serve the meal and, if needed, help clean the table afterward.",26
129,"""We just want to win,"" Gilgeous-Alexander said. ""And whatever it is in that situation, we're willing to do. We have guys that are unselfish, and that's why it works.""",27
130,"The Houston Rockets have the NBA's attention with their radical small-ball swerve, but the Thunder have been at their gamble since day one. It was borne out of necessity rather than strategy -- like most trendsetting moves -- but they committed to it and have leaned in. It's their not-so-secret weapon and what keeps them as the frisky, dangerous, nobody-wants-to-play-them wild card in the Western Conference playoff bracket.",28

133,"The Nuggets got several key players back into their lineup, but it wasn’t enough against a determined Thunder team, falling 113-101 in Oklahoma City. ",2
134,"Denver had a full contingent with Will Barton III, Mason Plumlee and Michael Porter Jr. returning to action after an extended absence due to injury, but the rust from a nine-day All-Star break appeared to be a factor for the Nuggets throughout Friday’s contest. ",3
135,"""It's a convenient excuse, coming off All-Star break, working guys back in. But if I've missed a month or a week, [you can still] defend, rebound and take care of the ball,"" Nuggets head coach Michael Malone told reporters after the game. ""I think there was definitely was a little bit of rust.""    Nikola Jokić led the Nuggets with 32 points, seven rebounds and five assists while Chris Paul helped the Thunder snap a seven-game losing streak to Denver, powering the home team with 29 points and four boards.    The Nuggets would hit just three of their opening nine shots and committed four turnovers in the first seven minutes of the game. Aside from a strong first quarter from Jokić, who had 11 points on 5-of-6 shooting, Denver struggled to find any rhythm offensively. The team shot just 36.4 percent in the first 12 minutes and only connected on two assists. The Thunder would take a 10-point lead after the first quarter, thanks to their second unit with Dennis Schroder and Nerlens Noel combining for 13.    Denver would pick up some momentum in the second quarter though. The Nuggets would use free throws to go on an 8-0 run. Jamal Murray would put his team back in front 37-36 with a three-pointer at the 5:25 mark. When Barton III pushed the score to 42-38, it appeared as if the team would continue to pad its lead. Chris Paul, however, would ensure that both sides went into the break tied at 48 as he hit a bucket at 2.7-second mark.    That moment appeared to spur on Paul, who would torch the Nuggets in the second half. Paul sparked an 11-1 run by Oklahoma City, with the guard scoring 11 in the quarter. Denver would respond with a 10-0 run of its own, thanks to Jokić. The center hit a three, forced a steal and assisted on Gary Harris’ three to bring his team within one. Things would unravel for the Nuggets in the final 12 minutes though.    Steven Adams scored 10 points in the fourth quarter and Paul would chip in another nine, helping the Thunder pad their lead to 12.    The outcome sees Denver lose their first division game of the season. The group will look to get back to winning ways when they host the Timberwolves on Sunday, featuring two former Nuggets in Malik Beasley and Juancho Hernangomez. ",4
136,"""This is our first division loss and my hope is that we'll come out with a much greater sense of urgency against Minnesota on Sunday afternoon, from [players] 1-15,"" Malone said.    Here are the takeaways:    Nikola Jokić continues OKC dominance    The Nuggets couldn’t extend their win streak against Thunder to eight games, but they can’t fault Jokić. During the win streak, which started on Feb. 1, 2018, Jokić averaged 25.6 points against the Nuggets’ Northwest Division rivals. The Serbian continued his hot hand against the Thunder.     When the Nuggets struggled early on, it was Jokić who kept them in the game, scoring five of the team’s seven opening field goals. The 25-year-old scored 19 of his 32 points in the first half, adding five boards and three assists in the first 24 minutes of the game.    Nuggets struggle to find balance   Jokić and Jamal Murray combined for 53 points, but the Nuggets’ inability to get the rest of the team going was the reason why they lost by 12 in Oklahoma City.    Aside from a solid performance from Barton III, who scored 16 points on 50 percent shooting and added nine rebounds and five assists, it was a quiet offensive night for many of Denver’s players. The team had four players who shot under 35 percent, including two starters. That’s not going to get it done against one of the Western Conference’s better teams in the Thunder. ",5
137,"""Other guys need to start stepping up,"" Malone said. ""Step up and help your team in some shape or form.""    Turnovers costly   One of the reasons why the team struggled to find a rhythm was due to carelessness on the ball. Denver conceded 19 turnovers, which the Oklahoma City Thunder scored 25 points from. ",6
138,"""We didn't take care of the ball, that was a huge issue and it happened all night long,"" Malone said. ""Good teams don't beat themselves and that's what we did.""    Again, some of likely was a result of several players working their way back into game action. With 26 games left on the season, it will be an area that will need monitoring. ",7

In 2014, Tubbs was a student at the University of Central Oklahoma and worked part-time waiting tables. Six years later, he is standing in Chicago’s Wintrust Arena, hosting the NBA’s Celebrity All-Star game during the 2020 All-Star Weekend.
 
The Thunder emcee’s journey from 20-year-old server to NBA All-Star host began with a favor and a wrinkled, mustard-stained T-shirt.
 
Tubbs heard from a friend about the Thunder auditions for its game-night entertainment group, the Storm Chasers. The group serves as the interactive hype team throughout home games. At the time, Tubbs was studying radio and television broadcasting with the hopes of one day being an on-air talent. However, the future of waiting tables didn’t include a microphone.
 
“I kind of knew that I wanted to be in front of a microphone in some capacity, but none of my jobs were leading to it at the time,” he said.

143,"
On a whim and partly as a favor to the friend who was too nervous to audition alone, Tubbs grabbed the only Thunder shirt he had ¬– a crumpled grey T-shirt with a massive mustard stain through the Thunder logo -- and tested his luck for a Storm Chaser spot. 
 
His lively personality and spritely character easily landed him the spot as a Storm Chaser, but also made a different impression on the NBA team’s Events and Entertainment department. Instead of being a member of the hype team, they thought Tubbs had the makings of an arena emcee. 
 


",3
144,"	
They were right. Tubbs went on to host every Thunder home game for the next six seasons; he also landed a position as a feature reporter for FOX 25 news, his current day job. Even still, the thought of hosting on the national stage was beyond his imagination. 
 
That is, until the Thunder’s annual employee holiday event in December. While hosting the event at a local bowling alley, Tubbs’ boss asked to take his microphone for a moment. Immediately, Tubbs was on alert; nobody takes his mic.
 
His suspicion subsided when John Leach, the team’s Director of Events and Entertainment,  announced that Tubbs would be joining Rumble the Bison and the Thunder’s in-house production team in Chicago to work All-Star weekend. 
 
“I was floored,” Tubbs admitted. “My jaw was literally on the ground.”

",4
145,"	
Fighting off tears, Tubbs ran to the bathroom where he immediately phoned his mom. He would be representing the Thunder on basketball’s biggest stage.
 
“I would like to think I’m an opportunist and whenever a really cool opportunity comes up, I want to take it and just see where it goes from there,” he said. “But to say I would be hosting the celebrity All-Star game alongside some of the most talented people in the world, I would never have imagined that.”
 
Just like any other Thunder home game, Tubbs guided the celebrities and the thousands of fans in the arena through whimsical festivities during the breaks in the game. However, instead of randomly selected Thunder fans, the contestants were national celebrities and instead of limiting the scene exclusively to the fans in the arena, Tubbs was broadcasted live on national television for millions of viewers watching at home.
 
“Seeing these celebrities who I see on TV all the time, I was a little starstruck. I was trying to keep it together, but also carry them through this game that I would carry our fans through in a similar game,” he said. “Treating them just like regular fans, regular players, but of course they’re celebrities, they’re All-Stars, so just trying to stay cool, calm and collected in the moment but also having a blast.”

Tubbs finished the game on basketball’s biggest stage without a hitch.
 
Only a select few NBA emcees make it to the All-Star stage each year. Out of the 30 in-game masters of ceremony, only six were chosen to represent their teams in Chicago. Among them was the Thunder’s trusty and charismatic host of six seasons. 
 
“It’s so humbling,” said Tubbs. “Just saying that I’m a part of that All-Star group for 2020 is amazing, mind-blowing.”
 
Tubbs’ weekend was filled with activity. In addition to the Celebrity All-Star game, he also hosted the USA Women’s National team practice and All-Star practice during his long weekend in Chicago.
 
“The energy was insane, of course,” he said of the celebrity game. “Take playoff game and multiply it by 10 and that’s what you get with All-Star.”
 
From a 20-year-old college student waiting tables part-time to an All-Star caliber NBA emcee, the weight and significance of it all still doesn’t escape Tubbs. During each Thunder home game, Tubbs’ energy never wavers. It’s not just a job that he takes seriously, but one that he loves.
 
 
“It’s the best feeling in the world. I can’t compare it to anything else, so for me to be able to go out here every night and be myself, to do what I do and have fun, it’s the best,” Tubbs said as he beamed with pride. “Nothing else compares, seriously. It’s the best thing on the planet. Hopefully, no one else takes my job because I would do this until I’m 100 years old.”

402,"World's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, left, of the Oklahoma City Thunder, shoots against the U.S. forward ... [+] Jaren Jackson Jr., of the Memphis Grizzlies, during the first half of the NBA Rising Stars basketball game in Chicago, Friday, Feb. 14, 2020. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh)",1
403,"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, just 21 years old, is blossoming into an NBA star for the Oklahoma City Thunder. Averaging 19.5 points per game, he leads Oklahoma City’s offensive attack with the most points on the entire team. In fact, he is fourth among all second year players in points per game. The Canadian also produces 6.1 rebounds, 3.2 assists, and 1.2 steals per contest. This impressive production earned him a spot at two different events at 2020 NBA All-Star Weekend in Chicago.",2
404,"The NBA Rising Stars Challenge is an event that brings the NBA’s best young talent onto the floor at the same time. Mainly first and second year players, these future NBA All-Stars, MVP’s, and potential Hall of Famers take the floor every year at NBA All-Star Weekend to get their first exposure to the weekend’s festivities. The event itself is a faced-paced, high-flying event that showcases who could be running the league in the years to come.",3
405,"After coming off the bench as a rookie in the 2019 NBA Rising Stars Challenge, Gilgeous-Alexander got the chance to start in this weekend’s event. One of four Canadians on the World team roster, he was ready to show the world his unique style of play.",4
406,"While most young guards utilize their strength and athleticism to score the ball on offense, Gilgeous-Alexander does quite the opposite. His finesse style of play, lulling defenders with crafty dribble moves, using angles to get to the rim, and adding the perfect amount of spin to the ball as he floats it up to the backboard is poetic.",5
407,"Defense isn't exactly a top priority in a game like this, but Gilgeous-Alexander scored at will in the first half. He had seven first quarter points in just 6 minutes and 49 seconds of play. This included a beautiful scoop shot from the right side of the rim, a step back 3-pointer, and a jaw-dropping transition layup sequence.",6
408,"With 13 points at halftime in just over 12 minutes of court time, Gilgeous-Alexander had been one of the best players on the floor. Not only was he great scoring the ball, but he showed a beautiful display of passing, getting the offense flowing and setting up his teammates for flashy finishes. Although his assist numbers on the season aren't as high as other point guards around the league, his ability to move the ball and orchestrate an offense is undeniable. ",7
409,"On the night, the 21-year-old finished with 16 points, 3 rebounds, 3 assists, and 1 block. He struggled from deep late, finishing 1-7 from beyond the arc, but nonetheless was one of the most impressive players at the 2020 NBA Rising Stars Challenge. Gilgeous-Alexander was a +8 (tied for best on team) on the box score in a 20 point loss which is impressive in itself, showing that his team played best with him on the floor.",8
410,"The very next night, Gilgeous-Alexander was fortunate enough to be a participant in the 2020 Taco Bell Skills Challenge. This is a competition of some of the most skilled players in the NBA, regardless of age. It is an event that showcases a player’s ability to dribble, pass, and shoot. He was matched up against Khris Middleton of the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round and was ultimately eliminated.",9
411,"After the disappointing finish, Gilgeous-Alexander spoke with The Oklahoman’s Maddie Lee and touched on what happened at the event and his desire to come back and redeem himself next year. While being eliminated in the first round ultimately wasn't what he wanted, it is still extremely impressive just how many events Gilgeous-Alexander was a part of throughout the weekend.",10
412,"Overall, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander shined throughout the weekend. While he isn't taking home any hardware, he is now even more of a household name around the entire world. He is certainly the face of the franchise in Oklahoma City going forward and is going through the same stages that players like Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden went through in their early days on the Thunder. ",11
413,"It won’t be long before we start seeing Gilegous-Alexander playing on Sunday during NBA All-Star Weekend at the main event — the NBA All-Star Game. The way he has improved his game in less than two NBA seasons is outstanding, and he will certainly be at many more NBA All-Star Weekends going forward.",12

NOTE TO USER: User expressly acknowledges and agrees that, by downloading and/or using this photograph, user is consenting to the terms and conditions of the Getty Images License Agreement.

417,"Of all years in which the Oklahoma City Thunder had the most incentive to make a trade, this was the one. With plenty of valuable assets they were willing to move for the right price, many thought this rebuilding year would result in multiple players being shipped off. Between Danilo Gallinari, Dennis Schroder, Steven Adams, Chris Paul, Nerlens Noel, and others, teams could call the Thunder front office to get any type of player they needed to acquire in order to improve. ",2
418,The only real trade rumor among Oklahoma City’s players that made headlines was a Danilo Gallinari trade to the Miami Heat. The Thunder had looked to be a third team in the Memphis Grizzlies and Miami Heat trade that would send Andre Iguodala to the Heat. ,3
419,"Oklahoma City, Miami, and Gallinari’s representatives worked all night to find a solution that would meet the needs of all parties. This would give Gallinari a brand new contract that would keep him in Miami for several more seasons. His current contract was set to expire this summer, making him a free agent. ",4
420,"Towards the end of the deadline, it appeared talks had stalled. The Heat were more than willing to take on Gallinari with a new contract, but not if it meant they had to dip into their cap number for the 2021 free agent class that includes Giannis Antetokounmpo.",5
421,"While the Gallinari trade fell through, and Oklahoma City once again made zero trade deadline moves, there is no reason for panic in Oklahoma City. While Nerlens Noel is set to be a free agent this summer, and likely will sign a large deal elsewhere, the Thunder still have a good chance to get assets in a Gallinari trade down the road. ",6
422,"Oklahoma City owns Gallinari’s Bird Rights, meaning they have the flexibility to pay him more than any other team. Furthermore, if he wants to play for a contender, it will have to be through a sign-and-trade with the Thunder since the only teams with cap space this summer are some of the bottom teams in the NBA. ",7
423,"The other veteran players who Oklahoma City might have shopped at the deadline will be just as valuable to teams across the league this summer as they were this week. With one less year on their contracts, guys like Chris Paul, Steven Adams, and Dennis Schroder will be highly coveted this summer in a very weak free agent class. ",8
424,"With the salary cap next season being lower than expected, on top of several teams with projected cap space making big moves at the deadline, it may not be a summer of money to spend like we expected. With all of this in mind, teams that want to improve their roster may have to do so through trading. The Thunder could be a very active team when it comes to the trade market this summer. ",9
425,"The Oklahoma City Thunder finds themselves at 32-20, which is good for the 6th seed in the Western Conference. They are a full game ahead of the Dallas Mavericks for that spot. They are just one game behind the Houston Rockets for the 5th seed and 1.5 games behind the Utah Jazz for the 4th seed in the West. ",10
426,"With that in mind, they have a chance to finish the season with a better playoff seeding than last year’s Oklahoma City team who was the 6th seed in the 2019 NBA Playoffs. This season’s roster that has had so much success to this point will be the same roster they take into the 2020 NBA Playoffs. With their chemistry, talent, and balanced scoring attack, the Thunder are a team nobody wants to see in the first round of the playoffs. ",11
427,"Oklahoma City still has one roster spot left that could be filled by two-way guard Lu Dort, who has started the last nine games for them and has been exceptional. Additionally, that spot could be filled buy a player on the buyout market if the Thunder wish to round out the roster for a playoff run. ",12
428,"While they didn’t get under the tax at the deadline by shedding salary, the Thunder still have the option to apply to have Roberson’s salary removed from their books or even waive a player to achieve this. Regardless, Oklahoma City likely has some internal decisions to make on what they want to do with the final roster spot and how to duck the tax bill. ",13
429,"For now, the Oklahoma City Thunder are looking to carry this roster into the playoffs and look to continue to shock the world as they have been one of the best teams in the NBA over the last couple of months. Since November 25, after their brutal West Coast road trip, they’ve gone 27-10, good for the second best record in the NBA. That 37 game stretch is nearly half of an entire NBA season, showing just how great the Thunder have been for a large portion of the season. As it stands now, Oklahoma City is also closer to being the top seed in the Western Conference than they are to falling out of the playoffs.",14

530,"It was late in November when the Oklahoma City Thunder were reeling at 5-10 and had occupied one of the lottery spots in the Western Conference, a predicted outcome. They were still fighting close battles but just didn't know how to close games.",1
531,Chris Paul was trying to take over games but was very streaky whereas the likes of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Danilo Gallinari were also struggling with shooting accuracy. Dennis Schroder was a shadow of his current self.,2
532,"Since then, Billy Donovan's men have gone on to record 27 wins, dropping only a further 11, a run that has seen the franchise becoming the first team in the league to beat its Vegas over/under threshold of 31.5 games.",3
533,"If you've seen enough of Dennis Schroder over the past couple of seasons, you know that he can easily start at the point for more than half of the teams in the association. It was with his rejuvenation that things started to come together for the Thunder.",4
534,"The 26-year-old guard finally started getting his shots on target and with that, Coach Donovan happily amped up his playing time in the rotation. Now when Chris Paul wasn't draining shots, Schroder and Gallo making the buckets.",5
535,This even took the pressure off Gilgeous-Alexander who was going through a rough patch in late November. He finally rediscovered his flow with the driving game and can now provide steady offense from most parts on the court.,6
536,"Finally, Steven Adams also wore off the early season struggles due to issues with his left knee. The Kiwi powerhouse is now back to being his best inside the paint and is a double-double threat every night.",7
537,"The three players that have drawn the most attention so far this season are CP3, SGA and Schroder. Seeing the trio close out games for the Thunder has become common sight now and for good reason.",8
538,"Firstly, nobody has more clutch points in the league this season than Chris Paul. The veteran guard knows how to read the game in trying situations and his ability to draw fouls and frustrate the opposition is second to none.",9
539,Schroder is a sneaky customer who will find his way to the rim for an easy layup if you overcommit or would rack up an open three if you take him lightly. Gilgeous-Alexander's rapid first step makes him difficult to guard whenever he decides to attack the rim.,10
540,"Additionally, all of the three bring respectable defensive qualities to the table. Paul and Schroder are pesky while guarding the ball while SGA's length and agility allow him to match-up with most players.",11
541,"As a result, the trio has the third-best net rating in all 3-man lineups that have played at least 30 games together this season. The triumvirate also has the best true shooting percentage of 67.6 in the aforementioned category.",12
542,"The Thunder have played a league-high 36 clutch games this season, winning 23 of them, again the best number in the association. The franchise also has the highest scoring accuracy in the league with the players making 50.4% of their clutch shot attempts.",13
543,"Back in December, the Oklahoma City Thunder enforced 26- and 24-point comeback victories in consecutive games against the Chicago Bulls and the Memphis Grizzlies respectively. During their 15th January matchup, the Thunder were trailing the Toronto Raptors by as many as 30 points in the second quarter. While the franchise did end up losing the game, the deficit was reduced to just three points late in the fourth.",14
544,"If you were to look at the individual plus/minus stats in the clutch for a minimum of 20 such games played, you'd find all of the top five spots being occupied by OKC players with Schroder leading the pack. Simply put, this is a team that refuses to go away.",15
545,"OKC's rotation is completed by the likes of Terrance Ferguson, Lu Dort, Abdel Nader, Darius Bazley and Nerlens Noel. If there's one common theme among all these aforementioned players, it's the fact that all of them play hardnosed defense.",16
546,"Ferguson, in particular, is one of the best on-ball defenders in the league. He surely does pick up those fouls, but he also manages to restrict his matchup on most nights. Dort, on the other end, just bamboozles the opposition with his energy. Nobody covers as much ground as he does and given the fact that he can shoot from downtown, he's increasingly looking like the prototypical 3-and-D wing whose services OKC could enjoy for years to come.",17
547,Noel is an absolute behemoth in the paint on both ends of the court while Nader has a sweet driving game in addition to his ability from range. Bazley is a great rim protector and always looks to attack the paint on offense.,18
548,"With a 32-21 record, the OKC Thunder currently occupy the sixth seed in the West and are most certainly a shoo-in for the playoffs. While they're not yet a team that could sweep the first round with ease, they'll give a lot of problems to whichever team they end up facing.",19
549,"The team's ability down the stretch is matched only by the cream-of-the-crop franchises in the league such as the Milwaukee Bucks and the Los Angeles Lakers. The presence of quality young players also means that the Thunder will drain their opponents off a lot of energy, something franchises looking for deep postseason runs absolutely want to avoid.",20
550,"While I don't feel the Thunder could survive the likes of the LA Clippers or the Lakers in the first round, if the franchise manages to retain the sixth seed or do one further, things could turn really interesting, The likes of Denver Nuggets, Utah Jazz, and Houston Rockets have faced enough slumps to give the Thunder some hope of progressing further than the first round of the playoffs if such matchups do fall in place.",21

555,"Two hot teams face offBoston Celtics @ Oklahoma City Thunder
Sunday, 20:30 GMT
Live on Sky Sports ArenaThe Celtics are a very tough team to beat. They rank second in scoring defence and while the offence has not been quite that good, they can certainly put up points. They have four players averaging over 17 points in Jayson Tatum, Kemba Walker, Jaylen Brown and Gordon Hayward. They are just a good, all-round team. They are chasing down the Bucks and Raptors in the Eastern Conference. Going 9-1 over the past 10 has certainly helped. The Thunder, also 9-1 over the same stretch, have been one of the big surprises of this season. When Chris Paul arrived in Oklahoma City many expected him to be moved on pretty quickly, but he has settled in and become a key part of this team. He is playing some of his very best basketball and really leading his younger teammates. This is a really tough game to call with two good teams, both in superb form. But the Celtics just have a little more talent and for that reason I am picking them to make it seven wins in a row. Lillard can lead the wayMiami Heat @ Portland Trail Blazers
Sunday, 02:00 GMT
Live on Betfair VideoDamian Lillard is arguably playing better basketball than any player in the league right now. He recently made his way onto the top 10 list for all time 50 point games. In his past ten he is averaging 41.6 points and 9.2 assists. He is just unstoppable right now. The season has been a little disappointing so far, but they will be looking to make a big second half push to make the playoffs. The Heat's tough defence will be key if they are going to come out of this with a win. They made some moves at the deadline, the biggest of those probably being the addition of Andre Iguodala. The moves they have made show they want to win now. They already had a team playing some excellent basketball, but the additions may well make them a legitimate title contender. Come playoff time they will be a team that others want to avoid.Lillard was fuming after a missed call at the end of the last game, and he could well carry that into this game and take it out on Miami. I am taking Portland to edge closer to those playoffs in what should be an excellent game. ",5

572,"Entering this Thursday’s trade deadline, it was unsure if Danilo Gallinari would be dealt or stay a member of the Oklahoma City Thunder.",2
573,"Throw in intrigue by the Miami Heat — or specifically, Pat Riley, one of the league’s most decorated executives who rarely misses when his eyes are set on the target — and speculation rose ten-fold.",3
574,"However, when all the dust settled and the theatrics came to a halt, nothing ended up materializing. Which was secretly the best possible outcome for the Thunder.",4
575,"With an expiring contract looming, Gallinari’s immediate future is still clouded by uncertainty. Given his skill set as a versatile wing that has multiple avenues to his offense and is efficient beyond the perimeter on impressive volume — it made sense why a contender would want to snag him.",5
576,"But the logistics of a deal between the Heat and Thunder were overwhelming and nothing came to fruition. Though returning assets would have likely included a late first-round draft pick, perhaps a couple of nice prospects and additional capital, the team could still look to deal him this summer with the potential of a similar return.",6
577,"Though he’ll be 32 years old this August, his game seemingly improves and refines with age. He doesn’t heavily rely on athleticism and is a skilled scorer than can maneuver to his spots; his versatility complements nearly any offense. Likewise, he’s not a liability on the other end of the court. He’s not exactly a lauded defender, but he’s capable, and that’s enough.",7
578,"It still won’t be simple, sign-and-trades rarely are, but that still represents an intriguing outlet to take. But for the time being, Gallo’s service will greatly help the Thunder’s playoff push.",8
579,"His base stats of 19.1 points, 5.7 rebounds, and 2.3 assists on .442/.410/.903 splits are impressive in their own right. He shoots the 3-ball efficiently and can find his way to the charity stripe. He’s essentially an analytical dream — proven by his 61.9 true shooting percentage, which is 22nd in the NBA.",9
580,"Under the tutelage of Billy Donovan, the Thunder’s combination of savvy veterans and youthful talent has meshed beautifully as the season progresses. They’re only 1.5 games behind the Utah Jazz and the fourth seed, which means the potential of hosting a playoff series at Chesapeake is still within reach.",10
581,"Forfeiting Gallinari, a player that can play within the flow of their offense and put up gaudy stats, would’ve made that task increasingly more difficult.",11
582,"Though this shouldn’t act as a reason to not make a move, I can’t lie: this team is just plain fun. They’re a joy for any basketball purist, casual fan, or those who routinely see themselves cheer for the underdog to watch. Their chemistry is something to behold, they play as a collective unit. Breaking that up prematurely would have been disappointing, especially with playoff implications on the line.",12
583,"It’s still likely that Gallinari is dealt this summer, but passing on any transaction this trade deadline works in favor for the time being.",13

That shouldn't be a problem considering trades like this are part of the reason why they acquired the chest of picks in the first place.",25
617,"Danilo Gallinari is probably the most likely to be traded on the current Thunder roster, if anyone. With that being said, he is in a unique situation. While he is arguably a top-five free agent this summer, and will get a big payday, it may be in the best interest in the team as well as Gallinari to wait it out and not move him at the deadline.",26
618,"Although he will become a free agent at that point, essentially only the bottom teams in the NBA will have cap space to throw money at him. With Oklahoma City owning his Bird Rights, they have the ability to pay him more than anyone this summer. A mutually agreed upon sign-and-trade would result in Gallinari getting paid as well as finding his way onto a contending roster. For the Thunder, this also benefits them as they would get assets in return as well.",27
619,"Overall, Oklahoma City will likely have to work with teams that have larger contracts to make a trade work. Nearly all of their most valuable assets they may look to trade make big money. Teams with expiring, large contracts will have the best chance to do business with the Thunder at the deadline. ",28
620,"Sam Presti will have the ability to play the market. If a great deal to sell comes around, he will do just that. If it is a buyer’s market, you may see Oklahoma City be a buyer. If there’s no deals that pique his interest, he could just as easily stand pat.",29

656,The trade deadline is quickly approaching.,1
657,"Oklahoma City as a team are currently in a state of flux. The Russell Westbrook era ended and the second Thunder U era has not started yet as Oklahoma City play out this season with Danilo Gallinari and Chris Paul. It is likely that there will be deals struck over the coming year which clearly establish the Thunder’s plans for the next few years. I wanted to try and understand how Sam Presti might act in this rebuilding stage therefore I have produced a trade book which identified short-term trades, long-term targets and bad contracts which the Thunder could absorb in the process of asset acquisition. Essentially, I wanted to produce a road-map of sorts which would outline short-term trades while also focusing on the long-term planning for the Thunder. This type of planning is a necessity for small market basketball teams as these teams generally do not attract All-Star level free agents, a key method of player procurement. ",2
658,All of the Thunder’s team-building has to come from within the organisation whether this be through trade or internal growth. ,3
659,"In terms of identifying the Thunder’s plan for the next five years, it was tricky to do so. Sam Presti has been coy in revealing his plans for the roster and has stuck to the principles he established in the pre-season media sessions. Oklahoma City will maintain discipline in the franchise’s discipline, it will not be a full scale rebuild as a result of a hasty tanking effort. There have been whispers which have slipped out from the Thunder’s organisation stating that Oklahoma City will not hesitate to pull off trades which directly benefit the organisation. I do not doubt that this is the case for one minute, if Sam Presti gets a good return on a player he will take it. ",4
660,I do think that the trade options are limited at the moment and there are no strong offers which will force Sam’s hand. ,5
661,"In the last few days, Steven Adams to Atlanta has been mentioned as a potential trade partner but I am not sure how believable this rumour is. Atlanta would have to give up young players like Cameron Reddish or Bruno Fernando to make this deal happen, the Hawks would also likely have to throw in a first round pick, something that Travis Schlenk will be reticent to do as Atlanta embraces the rebuild.",6
662,"With the Trade Book which I have produced, I have balanced the short-term aims with the long-term plans. In the short-term, Oklahoma City are largely expected to make the play-offs and I could see Sam Presti swinging a deal for a talented wing if the right offer arises. Oklahoma City have a dearth of big wings who can shoot the three efficiently and the Thunder will not dither in the pursuit of such a player. ",7
663,"Kevin O’Connor has previously spoken about Oklahoma City being potential buyers at the deadline according to league sources. Oklahoma City have traditionally operated in silence in terms of roster changes with very few details slipping out to the media. The best example of this would be the Paul George trade which happened out of nowhere, no media members seemed to know that this deal was happening until the last stages. There was a common belief that the Lakers would eventually put together the right package and get George to LA. Presti came out of nowhere with a package that satisfied Kevin Pritchard’s criteria. ",8
664,The reason why I believe that Kevin O’Connor’s statement holds weight is that it does reflect the Thunder’s current position. Presti holds a lot of assets which can be used to get players who make the Thunder better short-term and long-term. ,9
665,"A deal like Robert Covington presents the opportunity to acquire a versatile 3&D wing who is a multi-positional All-Defensive Team players. That is a skill-set which makes Oklahoma City better in the short-term while also getting an asset that could be dealt in the long-term. Covington could be flipped at the end of the season if the Thunder wanted a return on their investment, all contending teams want a high-level player who fits that mould especially with teams in the modern NBA. ",10
666,"A lot of teams such as the Lakers, Bucks and Clippers run a variation of the spread pick and roll which places offensive responsibilities on one player with the other four having simplified roles. There is value in a player who knows how to perform their role to a high level.",11
667,"Chris Paul still got it, man. That was fun. Love the 3-guard lineup to finish—so many shot creators can make it hard to contain. It'll be fascinating to see what they do prior to the deadline. Some league executives I recently spoke with believe OKC is a stealth buyer. We'll see. pic.twitter.com/b5PbJTr9eb",12
668,"Using the deep dive which I have conducted, I have inputted a few potential trades into the ESPN Trade Machine to see if these ideas work. ",13
669,"This is the potential trade package for Robert Covington that would make sense for both sides. Minnesota would get a forward who profiles as a 3&D player who has all of the tools to be an elite defender. Ferguson’s length, activity and acceleration means that he could be a top-level stopper. He is a reactive defender rather than being pro-active like Andre Roberson but it does seem to work for Ferguson, he is consistently an impactful player on defence. Moreover, Minnesota will get some cap relief which could work in their favour in the upcoming free agency period. Providing that the vision of a D’Lo/KAT future is real, it can be made tangible if Minnesota gets that cap space to build a good, young team. Dieng would obviously be used to match contracts but a deal involving a young guy like Culver and a pick in the future could be a decent haul for the Warriors. Minnesota could build around a two-man core and use that additional financial leverage to acquire solid rotation players who can provide depth to a thin team. ",14
670,OKC Receive: Robert Covington,15
671,"Minnesota Receive: Andre Roberson, Terrance Ferguson and 2020 Denver Pick",16
672,"A deal with Philadelphia does feel like an inevitability because of the Sixers’ glaring needs. Ben Simmons is a really good play-making forward who is an adept defender at his position. but his impact falls of a cliff in the play-offs. We have seen teams scheme Simmons out of the series last year which was fine because Philly had Jimmy Butler who could close in late game situations. Butler being in Miami means that the Sixers have way less options, it is either persist with Simmons or switch to Raul Neto. Chris Paul provides experience, leadership and All-Time ability from the point guard spot. It is optimistic to include Tobias Harris in this scenario but I do not currently like his fit on Philadelphia. Harris is the type of player who can play off-ball but works best when he is being fed the ball as an almost primary option. It was one of the reasons why the Clippers’ offence worked so efficiently during the first half of last season as they had consistent, balanced scoring from like four players. He is much lower-usage on the Sixers and is relegated to a spot-up shooter in their lineups at times, an under-usage of his skill-set. It is more likely that Al Horford will be attached in the deal but Presti has shown an ability to produce magic at the table in the past.",17
673,OKC Receive: Tobias Harris + Zhaire Smith,18
674,Philly Receive: Chris Paul,19

699,OKLAHOMA CITY -- Oklahoma City Thunder guard Chris Paul missed his first game of the season Monday as he mourned the death of his friend Kobe Bryant. The team officially cited personal reasons for his absence.,1
700,"Following the Thunder's game Saturday against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Paul returned home to Los Angeles for his daughter's dance recital and was there when news broke Sunday of Bryant's death.",2
701,"""I've had several conversations with him,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""I'd like to keep our conversations private. That's kind of between Chris and I, but he's doing fine. It's a personal day for him.""",3
702,"Paul and Bryant grew close while playing on two Olympic teams together, as well as connecting as fathers playing in the NBA. At Bryant's final All-Star Game in 2016, Paul, along with friends Carmelo Anthony and Dwyane Wade, hosted a celebratory dinner for Bryant. They presented Bryant with retirement gifts such as a subscription to Netflix, underwear and reading glasses, with Paul giving him a cane.",4
703,"Bryant and Paul nearly became teammates in 2011, when the then-New Orleans Hornets agreed to a three-team trade with the Lakers and Rockets that would've sent Paul to Los Angeles. The trade was vetoed by Commissioner David Stern for ""basketball reasons,"" as the league owned the Hornets at the time during an ownership transition.",5
704,Paul's teammate Shai Gilgeous-Alexander arrived at the arena Monday wearing a yellow Bryant No. 8 jersey.,6
705,"Paul, 34, has been an essential part of the Thunder's surprising season, averaging 17.2 points, 5.0 rebounds and 6.4 assists in 47 games. He leads the league in clutch-time scoring, boosting the Thunder as one of the most dangerous fourth-quarter teams in the league. OKC is 28-19, seventh in the West but only a game out of fifth, behind Dallas and Houston.",7

818,The Celtics begin a stretch of games where they will play 6 of the next 7 games on the road. They visit the Oklahoma City Thunder for this game and then will play in Houston on Tuesday before returning home to play the LA Clippers. They will then embark on a 4 game Western road trip after the All Star break. ,4
819,"They visit the Oklahoma City Thunder for the first of two meetings this season. They will meet again in Boston on March 8. The Thunder has been one of the surprise teams this season. They weren’t expected to do much after losing Russell Westbrook, but they have surprised everyone and are in the midst of the playoff picture in the West. ",5
820,"The Celtics are 3rd in the East, 2 games ahead of the 4th place Miami Heat and 2 games behind 2nd place Toronto Raptors. They are 14-10 on the road and 9-1 in their last 10 games.

834,Key Matchups ,20
835,"Kemba Walker vs Chris PaulChris Paul’s veteran leadership is one of the reasons for the Thunder’s surprise success this season. He is averaging 17.1 points, 5.0 rebounds, 6.6 assists, and 1.6 steals per game.  He is shooting 47.9% from the field and 35.4% from beyond the arc. He is always a threat to score both in the paint and on the perimeter. ",21
836,"Gordon Hayward vs Shai Gilgeous-AlexanderGilgeous-Alexander is another reason for the success of the Thunder. He is averaging 19.5 points, 6.2 rebounds and 3.2 assists. He is shooting 46.2% from the field and 33.7% from beyond the arc. Hayward needs to stay with him to prevent him from having a big game. ",22
837,"Honorable MentionJayson Tatum vs Danilo GallinariGallinari is also playing well for the Thunder. He is averaging 19.1 points, 5.7 rebounds and 2.3 assists. He is shooting 43.9% from the field and 40.5% from beyond the arc. Of all the Thunder, he is the one who is most likely to get hot from the perimeter. Jayson has been playing very well for the Celtics and in addition to his offense, the Celtics will need him to play tough defense on Gallinari. ",23
838,"Player to WatchDennis SchroderSchroder comes off the bench and often plays down the stretch for the Thunder. He is averaging 19.3 points, 3.9 rebounds and 4.1 assists. He is shooting 47.7% from the field and 38.7% from beyond the arc. The Celtics need to defend him well as he can take over a game when he comes in. ",24
839,Keys to the GameDefense - Defense is always a key to winning. The Celtics will need to defend the perimeter as well as the inside because they have players who can score both inside and out. The Thunder tend to take care of the ball and turn it over only 13.7 times per game (7th). The Celtics will need to work hard on defense if they want to get steals and get easy baskets from them. The Celtics are 3rd with a defensive rating of 105.3 while the Thunder are 11th with a defensive rating of 107.7. The Celtics need to play tough team defense if they hope to get a win in this game on the road. ,25
840,Rebound - Rebounding is also a key to winning. Much of rebounding is desire and effort and the Celtics have to put in the extra effort to grab rebounds. They need to rebound on the defensive end to keep the Thunder from getting second chance points and they need to rebound on the offensive end to give themselves extra possessions. ,26
841,Defend Without Fouling - One of the things that has helped the Thunder to get wins is that they get to the line an average of 5+ more times than their opponents. They are very good at drawing fouls and the Celtics need to be careful to defend without fouling. Those extra free throws add up and can cause frustration for the opponent. The Celtics have to keep their focus and not let the calls take them out of their game. ,27
842,"Be Aggressive - The Celtics have to be aggressive and fight for loose balls, 50/50 balls, and rebounds, and be aggressive on defense and in going to the hoop. They have to be the more aggressive team and the team that plays harder. They have to be the team that wants to win more and play harder on both ends of the court. ",28
843,Play 48 Minutes - The Celtics have had games where they play very well in the first half and build a lead but then let up in the second half. Then in other games they dig a hole in the first half and then play very well in the second half to come back. They have to play hard and be consistent from start to finish with no let up in effort.  ,29
844,X-FactorsOn the Road - The Celtics are on the road and the Chesapeake Energy Arena is one of the toughest places to play. Their fans are loud and make it tough for teams coming there. The Celtics have to focus on playing their game and not let the distractions of the road take them out of their game. ,30
845,Officiating - Officiating is always an x-factor. How the refs call the game has a big influence on how the teams play. Will they let them play or call every little bit of contact? Will they call it evenly or will they favor one team or the other. Will they be influenced by the home crowd or will they call it fairly for both teams? It all effects the outcome of the game.,31

878,"The Boston Celtics made up for that lackluster blah game against the Atlanta Hawks. The Celtics and the Oklahoma City Thunder went at each other from the jump, taking turns making runs at one another and getting elite play from multiple players.",2
879,This was a very good basketball game.,3
880,1st Quarter: 32-28 Oklahoma City,4
881,"Both teams really executed well in the first quarter, but the Thunder just executed better. They were crisp, attacking the Celtics defense, creating mismatches, and drawing fouls. They generated six more shots than Boston in that quarter, most of them in the paint. The 14-4 points in the paint disparity was the only glaring thing that stood out. OK got 9 early points out of Danilo Gallinari, who punished the Celtics decision to switch Kemba Walker onto him. The Celtics got good production out of Gordon Hayward, who had 7 points, 2 rebounds, and an assist.",5
882,"Notable thing that happened: The actual starting unit was healthy! This was the just the 16th time the Celtics were able to start Walker, Hayward, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Daniel Theis.",6
883,"2nd Quarter: 29-24 Oklahoma City, game score 61-52 Oklahoma City",7
884,"Jayson Tatum came out strong after a quiet first quarter to score 7 early points, the last of which gave Boston a lead. OKC took it back by attacking Romeo Langford. They went on a 15-2 run by simply attacking that weak spot on the Celtics defense. Offensively, the Celtics cooled off a bit, and OKC’s rebounding wouldn’t let them get any second chances. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was a beast in the quarter. Kemba Walker went into halftime with 13 points but he had to work really hard for those points.",8
885,Notable thing that happened: Marcus Smart picked up his third foul and had to sit early in the quarter.,9
886,"3rd Quarter: 32-23 Boston, game score 84-84",10
887,"The Celtics recovered very nicely to start the quarter with Gordon Hayward initiating some good offense. Tatum took over after that, scoring 12 points in the quarter. Jaylen Brown chipped in 8 and Hayward 6. OKC’s bench came in and helped close a gap the Celtics had opened to go into the 4th quarter tied.",11
888,Notable thing that happened: The Celtics started attacking and getting offensive rebounds. They got 6 in the third quarter after getting 3 in the entire first half.,12
889,"4th Quarter: 28-27 Boston, game score 112-111 Boston",13
890,"The Thunder attacked Enes Kanter in pick-and-rolls, scoring easily early and forcing Brad Stevens to remove him from the game. The Celtics countered a 1-2 punch of Tatum and Smart, who combined for Boston’s first nine points of the quarter. They put together a 7-0 run to take a six point lead almost halfway through the quarter. Boston’s attacking continued and they did a nice job finding Daniel Theis when the OKC defense overreacted. The Thunder stayed close by drawing fouls and hitting their free throws. Kemba Walker took over down the stretch, hitting back-to-back 3′s to give Boston an 8 point lead. The Celtics got a little sloppy down the stretch, but held on to win.",14
891,"Notable thing that happened: With OKC down 3 looking to tie the game, Marcus Smart straight up ripped Gilgeous-Alexander. He got it up to Kemba Walker, who was fouled and hit the game-clinching free throw. ",15
892,"Tatum finished with 26 points on 10-for-19 shooting. He also had 11 rebounds. Walker only shot 6-for-16, but he was 4-for-9 from 3 and 11-for-13 from the line for 27 points. Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, and Daniel Theis combined for 43. ",16
893,Highlights of the Game,17
894,"This is an elite drive by Jayson Tatum. The changes of direction, the splitting of the double team, the finish. This might be the best drive of his career. I know he’s dunked on guys, but this level of skill to get himself to the rim is something else.",18
895,Yup. Looks like an All-Star to me. pic.twitter.com/ltEgdr3e9r,19

899,The Celtics did a great job tightening up some of the things that were killing them in the first half. The cut the OKC Thunder offensive rebounds in half while attacking and generating some second chances of their own. Their halftime adjustments paid off. ,23
900,"Gordon Hayward played great in this game and that shouldn’t get lost in this. He was the best player on the floor until Tatum took over, and he then let Tatum and Walker do their thing down the stretch.",24

In this serious post-All-Star Break, we’ll go over the outlook for every team in the NBA. Here, we’ll provide a short glimpse at championship odds and playoff chances for each team on DraftKings Sportsbook. Also highlighted are key injuries to note and a fantasy basketball player to watch the rest of the season. ",3

1022,"OKC entered the All-Star Break in a much better position than anybody really envisioned at the beginning of the season. Chris Paul has worked out with the Thunder so far and the team is in position to secure a playoff berth despite losing Russell Westbrook and Paul George. Pretty incredible. The issue is making the playoffs in the West outside of the top 4 seeds seems pointless. The Thunder will likely need to face either the Clippers, Nuggets or Jazz in the first round. Can they give any of those teams a series? Sure. Can they win said series? The odds are slim. The Thunder lack depth and size in the front court, which would cause issues against any team other than the Rockets. Ultimately, OKC will still be looking to the future, which is bright considering how well Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has looked. ",5
1023,Prediction: Thunder secure the No. 7 seed and lose in the first round. ,6
1024,"Darius Bazley, SF (knee) — out indefinitelyAndre Roberson, SG (knee) — out indefinitely",7
1025,"The Thunder aren’t going through any major injuries down the stretch, which should help them keep ground in the playoff seeding. Bazley has shown some promise this season as a serviceable big/wing player. He’s expected to be out until March at the earliest. Roberson has no timetable for a return from his knee injury and may be held out the rest of the year. Neither player contributes much, but again, it’s an issue of depth. The Thunder should be fine with the rotation they have, but if Nerlens Noel or Steven Adams were to miss extended time, that wouldn’t be good. Both players have dealt with various injuries all season and are at risk. ",8
1026,"We all know about the three-headed guard trio the Thunder roll out, but like I’ve mentioned, the front court is lacking. This makes Noel’s role even more important and he’s actually bounced back nicely this season when healthy. In 46 games, he’s averaging 7.8 points, 5.2 rebounds and 1.5 blocks in 18.7 minutes per contest. If we stretch that out a bit, it’s 15.1 points, 9.9 rebounds, 2.8 blocks and 2.0 steals per 36 minutes. If Noel can start getting around the 25-30 minutes per game, his fantasy value could really spike down the stretch and into the fantasy basketball playoffs. I’d put Noel on my season-long radar moving forward if I were in need of defensive stats and rebounds. ",9

1040,"OKLAHOMA CITY - Chris Paul gets annoyed when the topic of the Thunder's ""surprising"" success comes up.",1
1041,"Expectations for Oklahoma City were low for many after an offseason during which the Thunder collected draft picks, traded Russell Westbrook to the Houston Rockets for Paul and sent Paul George to the Los Angeles Clippers for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Danilo Gallinari.",2
1042,Many weren't sure if Oklahoma City's new players would function well together - or if the group would stay together.,3
1043,"It also wasn't clear if Paul could perform at an elite level at age 34, or if he could stay healthy. But Paul has embraced what appeared to be an undesirable situation and was named an All-Star for the 10th time. The Thunder not only stayed intact but come out of the All-Star break sixth in the Western Conference and firmly in the playoff race.",4
1044,"Asked what skeptics might have missed when projecting Oklahoma City to be one of the worst teams in the league, Paul bluntly said, ""That I was here.""",5
1045,Paul also isn't satisfied with Oklahoma City's 33-22 record going into Friday's home game against Denver.,6
1046,"""I expected the record to be better, you know what I mean?"" he said. ""I expect to win every night. I'm not as surprised as y'all are, I guess. I'm just not.""",7
1047,"He missed being that clutch player while deferring to James Harden in Houston. Now that he's the man again, he earned his way to being named an All-Star for the first time since 2016.",8
1048,"""That's why you play these games,"" Paul said. ""For that adrenaline.""",9
1049,"Paul immediately established himself as a leader. He had the team fitted for custom suits, and before a December game against Memphis, the players walked into Chesapeake Energy Arena wearing them. The Thunder overcame a 24-point deficit that night to win 126-122.",10
1050,Paul's team-building efforts have carried over onto the court.,11
1051,"""He's one of the top point guards to ever play this game,"" Thunder guard Dennis Schroder said. ""He changed the culture here as well -- how we're playing together as a team. He's talking to every one of us every time during games, practices. Even if you're off the court, he talks to us. A leader in this group.""",12
1052,"In some ways, Paul's 15th season has been one of his best. He is shooting 55% on 2-point shots, the highest mark of his career. He is shooting 89.8% from the free-throw line, which would be his second-highest percentage for a season. He averages 17.4 points, 6.7 assists and 5.0 rebounds per game.",13
1053,"""I think it speaks to him from the standpoint of just how diligent he is and how driven and motivated he is to try to get every once out of his own ability, from dieting to training to working out to shooting,"" coach Billy Donovan said.",14
1054,"Paul kept rolling by posting 23 points and six assists in the All-Star Game. He wasn't chosen as a starter, but Team LeBron coach Frank Vogel had him in at the end.",15
1055,"""It's about working hard, and it's the analytics and the statistics that say at this age you can do this or you can do that -- look at my brother Bron (LeBron James),"" Paul said after the game. ""Every year, they say he's going to slow down, right? And then what? So I think it's more about competing with yourself and not worry about what everybody else is saying.""",16
1056,"For as much as Paul's play has stood out, he's happy to see others succeeding. He loves the fact that the Thunder don't really have a standout player. Gilgeous-Alexander is a rising star in his second year, averaging 19.5 points and 6.1 rebounds per game. Gallinari, a veteran forward, is averaging 19.3 points and 5.7 rebounds. Schroder is averaging 19.3 points and 4.0 assists and is a top contender for Sixth Man of the Year. Steven Adams is averaging 10.7 points and 9.3 rebounds.",17
1057,"""They probably, other than Memphis, they have probably been the most surprising team in the league,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""They just have a way of hanging in games and closing them. They've got guys like (Danilo) Gallinari, Chris Paul, and (Dennis) Schroder -- all of those guys have been in positions where they've closed games, and that's exactly what they did.""",18
1058,Paul likes it that way.,19
1059,"""Everything is by committee,"" he said. ""I think our coaches do a great job of engaging us. We've just got a really great group of guys. Obviously, winning games helps that.""",20

1175,"The oddsmakers in Las Vegas usually know what they’re talking about.But even they get things wrong from time to time, and this season in the NBA there have been a few notable misses from all those preseason prognostications — specifically, ones made in relation to the Memphis Grizzlies and Oklahoma City Thunder.The Grizzlies have already topped most preseason projections for their win total. The sports books had them around 27 wins, and the Ja Morant-led club already has 28 wins and is holding down the Western Conference’s No. 8 playoff spot with 28 games left.“We are just young, very athletic and just get out and run,” said Morant, a clear Rookie of the Year front-runner and probably the favorite at this point. “I feel like we all have something to prove. We just go out with this chip on our shoulder. We keep proving people wrong. But we go out every night and play together.”And the Thunder, who were expected to freefall after losing Paul George, were slotted by most books as a 32-win team or so. They’re at 33-22, firmly in the West playoff race, led by a resurgent All-Star in Chris Paul.It’s clear that many thought the Thunder — the supposedly rebuilding Thunder — wouldn’t be a postseason team. Then again, many of those same people probably thought Paul wasn’t still capable of leading the way he has this season.“For me, it's always about the journey,” Paul said. “It's about working hard, and it's the analytics and the statistics that say at this age you can do this or you can do that. ... I think it's more about competing with yourself and not worry about what everybody else saying.”There have been a couple other notable surprises in Miami and Toronto.The Heat didn’t make the playoffs last year, lost Dwyane Wade to retirement and brought in Jimmy Butler to lead a largely very young, very unproven core this season. And it has worked: The Heat are in the mix for home-court in the first round, and are thinking even bigger than that.“It started in the summer,” said first-time All-Star Bam Adebayo, this year’s NBA Skills Competition winner. “It's building habits. Jimmy is one of those guys. He wants to hold people to a higher standard. Our organization wants to hold people to a higher standard. So it just made it all synch together. Everybody doesn't take anything personal when somebody gets on them. It's all love at the end of the day.”And then there’s the Raptors.They lost NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard, the MVP of this year’s All-Star Game. They lost Danny Green. They’ve been walloped this year by injuries. Despite it all, they’re No. 2 in the East right now and aren’t just on pace to win more regular-season games than they did in their championship season a year ago — they’re on pace to set a franchise record.“The journey is the best part about it,” Raptors All-Star guard Kyle Lowry said. “You’ve got to enjoy and have fun with the journey every single day. ... The thing that matters to me is that we’re continuing to be a better team every single night.”All-Star Game rewindIt’s worth taking one more look inside some numbers of that wild fourth quarter of Sunday’s All-Star Game, and how the intensity got seriously ramped up with the new target-score, untimed-play format for the last period in Chicago.To begin, the game wasn’t shorter with the clock being turned off and the teams playing for a score of 157 — it was longer. An Associated Press analysis of the fourth quarter shows the teams were on the floor for about 14:11, more than the customary 12 minutes.A few other nuggets:Dunks: There were 50 by the AP count in the first three quarters, including four in a span of 33 seconds. In the fourth quarter, only three dunks.Fouls: The teams combined for 14 fouls in the first three quarters, then committed 21 in the fourth.Free throws: The teams were 5 for 13 in the first three quarters, 18 for 26 in the fourth.Shooting: Team LeBron was shooting 52% after three quarters, then dipped to 42% in the fourth. But Team Giannis went from sailing to sputtering — 59% in the first three quarters, 26% the rest of the way.Kyrie's new jobBrooklyn guard Kyrie Irving has a new job: He’s now a vice president of the National Basketball Players Association.The NBPA had its winter meeting in the Bahamas on Monday. Irving is replacing Pau Gasol, whose three-year term expired.""At this point in my career, I wanted to join forces with those guys and take a bigger role outside of the basketball court and within our union,” Irving said. “I want to help move the union forward with innovative ideas, not only on social issues but also with business ventures into a new space.”Irving joins an executive committee that includes NBPA President Chris Paul, First Vice President Andre Iguodala, Vice Presidents Bismack Biyombo, Malcolm Brogdon, Jaylen Brown, CJ McCollum and Garrett Temple, and Secretary-Treasurer Anthony Tolliver.The week aheadA short week, but here’s games to watch starting Thursday when the season resumes:Thursday, Brooklyn at Philadelphia: Let the jostling for Eastern Conference positioning begin.Friday, New Orleans at Portland: A pair of teams looking to get hot and sneak in down the stretch.Saturday, Cleveland at Miami: The Heat will send Dwyane Wade’s No. 3 jersey to the rafters.Sunday, Boston at L.A.

1461,"The Thunder enters this one 17th in the league in scoring offense as they average 110.6 points per game. Oklahoma City is 22nd in rebounding with 43.1 boards a night while ranking 27th in assists by dishing out 22 dimes per game. The Thunder stands 10th in the league in scoring defense by allowing 108 points per contest. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is leading Oklahoma City with 19.5 points plus 6.1 rebounds per game on the season. Danilo Gallinari contributes 19.3 points plus 5.7 rebounds per game while Chris Paul chips in 17.4 points plus 6.7 assists a night. The Thunder can look to Steven Adams (10.7 points, 9.3 rebounds) and Dennis Schroder (19.3 points, 3.8 rebounds, four assists) in order to get their offense going. Terrance Ferguson, Mike Muscala, Nerlens Noel, Abdel Nader and Darius Bazley all have to contribute for the Thunder to have success. Oklahoma City is tied for 6th in the league in field goal percentage as they hit 47.1 percent from the floor as a team this season. The Thunder is tied for 26th in threes made per game as they drain 10.5 per contest while ranking tied for 17th by hitting 35.4 percent of their attempts from beyond the arc.",14

1468,These two teams are part of a three-team race in the Northwest Division with the Jazz. Denver has gotten healthier with Murray and Millsap returning right before the All-Star break. The Nuggets expect to have Plumlee and Porter Jr. back for this contest as well. Oklahoma City has overachieved coming into this contest and it will be interesting to see how things unfold for them down the stretch. The Thunder still lacks the depth that most serious playoff teams have in their respective rotations coming into this one. Denver has won seven straight in the series and they should take care of business here behind their stars.,21

1484,They’ve done this by moving the ball and pulling off insane comebacks against teams in the league. The local narrative in Oklahoma City from fans and local sports radio is that this team is fun to watch. The isolation-style basketball under the leadership of Westbrook is a thing of the past. ,5
1485,"Now, people are on edge as the trade deadline approaches, hoping that general manager Sam Presti doesn’t move players to keep this team intact. Also noteworthy, is the players are listening to head coach Billy Donovan as he is a candidate for coach of the year. ",6

1573,"Growing up in Canada, Luguentz Dort did not start playing organized basketball until age 12. Just eight years later, as an undrafted rookie, he is making an incredible impact for the Oklahoma City Thunder as a starting wing at the NBA level as a two-way player.",2
1574,"Back in college, Dort broke the freshman debut points record at Arizona State with 28 points, 9 rebounds, and 3 steals in his first ever college game. Overall in his lone college season, he was one of the Pac 12's best players, producing 16.1 points and 4.3 rebounds per game while earning All-Pac-12 Second Team, Pac-12 All-Defense Team, Pac-12 All-Freshman Team, and Pac-12 Freshman of the Year honors.",3
1575,"During his pre-draft process, after making that Pac-12 All-Defense team, Dort made it known that he was going to make an impact on the defensive end at the next level.",4
1576,"I spoke with Dort at Thunder Media Day before the season kicked off, and it seemed like he was ready to contribute at the NBA-level immediately. That has certainly been the case early in his career, on both ends of the ball.",5
1577,"As expected for someone who went undrafted, Dort started his career in the G-League playing for the Oklahoma City Blue. Through just 13 games, averaging 19.5 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game with the Blue, he had proven himself enough to start playing up with the Thunder.",6
1578,"Initially coming off of the bench, Dort was a high-energy guy who always brought a spark to the second unit with his elite athleticism and high motor. He was also tasked with guarding some of top scorers in the NBA, including Damian Lillard and Donovan Mitchell mid-way through the season.",7
1579,"Just one game after doing an exceptional job guarding Lillard, Dort got his chance to shine as a starter. After coming off the bench in his first eight NBA appearances, he would get the chance to start against the Houston Rockets in the absence of Terrance Ferguson due to personal reasons.",8
1580,"Even with Ferguson back in the lineup and available to start, Dort has retained the starting small forward job for the time being. In the ten games he has started, he has guarded the NBA’s premier guards from the tip, including James Harden, Trae Young, Luka Doncic, De’Aaron Fox, Devin Booker, and Jayson Tatum.",9
1581,"While his defensive rating doesn't stand out as positive (112.0), just watching him guard some of these guys passes the eye test. Additionally, the fact that Billy Donovan and the rest of the coaching staff has tasked him with these defensive assignments from the beginning of his NBA career tells you exactly how great of a defender he is. He could really pan out to be a player with a role similar to Marcus Smart.",10
1582,"On the offensive end this season, Dort has also shown flashes of productivity. He’s averaged 5.8 points on 31.8 percent from deep in just 20.7 minutes per contest. What is most impressive is his comfort within his role. Dort lets the offense come to him and rarely shoots a bad shot. Open 3-pointers and hard attacks at the rim are his specialty on offense. He even had an outburst for a career-high 23 points in Sacramento against the Kings late in January.",11
1583,"Dort is extremely versatile on both ends of the floor. Not only can he guard essentially any position on defense, but he also can play a variety of spots on the offensive end. According to Basketball Reference, he’s played 76 percent of his time at small forward, 20 percent at shooting guard, three percent at power forward, and one percent at point guard.",12
1584,"Still on a two-way contract, Lu Dort is clearly due for a full-time NBA contract. Oklahoma City still has an open roster spot that he could fill by the end of the season. Due to limits on how many days two-way players can spend with an NBA team, he currently isn't practicing with the Thunder. This goes to show how important it is that the Thunder get him inked to a multi-year NBA deal sooner than later. ",13
1585,"What could his contract look like? Dort’s teammate Deonte Burton was in his shoes last season as a two-way player who earned a full-time NBA contract. Burton was promoted on March 10, 2019 to a two-year deal worth roughly $3.1 million. While that isn't a huge number relative to other players around the league, this is significantly more than the $79,568 Dort is currently making as a two-way player.",14
1586,"The Thunder have gone 8-2 in the ten games Luguentz Dort has started this season. Part of that is good timing and a hot-streak for Oklahoma City, but there is no doubt Dort has been a big part of this winning streak overall. There isn’t many two-way players out there right now that you can plug into the starting lineup of a playoff team and have sustained success on both ends of the floor. He has truly been a diamond in the rough, leaving many wondering how nobody selected him in the 2019 NBA Draft.",15

1607,Shai Gilgeous-Alexander leads the Thunder with 19.6 points per contest and also has 6.2 boards and is only in his second year in the NBA.,2
1608,Point guard Dennis Schroder is second on the team in scoring and averages nearly four rebounds and just over four assists a game this season for OKC. Danilo Gallinari chimes in with about 19 points from his power forward spot and has 5.7 boards per game with teammate Steven Adams posting nearly 11 points per game to go along with a team-high 9.2 rebounds.,3
1609,Nerlens Noel — another Kentucky product — has just over eight points and five boards per game this season for the Thunder.,4
1610,"Yes, the Thunder are shooting about 35% from beyond the arc, but they are getting sound contributions from multiple players and have good quality veterans on the roster.",5
1611,"OKC has won nine of their last 11 games and Schroder has led the team in scoring in five of those contests. The Thunder started the season 8-12, before going 7-2 in their following nine ball games. Chris Paul, 34, averages 6.6 assists per game and led OKC in points with 22, during their 108-101 win versus Detroit on Friday.",6
1612,"OKC has fared well against some of the better teams in the West. Thunder faithful can appreciate victories over Houston, Toronto, the Los Angeles Clippers and Utah.",7
1613,OKC also got nice wins against San Antonio and Portland. The Thunder will face the Spurs again tonight and will host Denver after the All-Star break. The ball game will be held next Friday.,8
1614,OKC currently sits as the 6th seed in the Western Conference standings and are a game back of Houston. They are also 2.5 back of Utah for the 4th spot. It’s hard to imagine the Thunder missing out on the playoffs if they keep playing like this.,9
1615,Dallas and Memphis are behind OKC in the standings but don’t appear as though they are getting as much of a complete team effort like the Thunder are.,10
1616,,11
1617,"OKC isn’t going to draw in big-name free agents and will remain focused on getting talent from the draft. Paul, Gallinari, and Schroder could all be shipped away to other teams in the next calendar year, so don’t be too comfortable with OKC’s current set up.",12
1618,"Head coach Billy Donovan should be under consideration for the Coach of the Year award. After all, OKC could have easily been worse with veterans who surely want to win a championship.",13
1619,Kudos to the Sooner State squad for pulling together and being a competitive bunch with some questions surrounding them after trading away All-Stars like Russell Westbrook and Paul George.,14

1625,Oklahoma City look to maintain their winning ways,1
1626,Oklahoma City play against Atlanta tonight who are one of the worst teams in the league.  The Thunder have done really well of late and the team’s record since Thanksgiving stands at 20-8. That is a seriously impressive mark for a team that many of the NBA’s national media thought would miss the play-offs at the start of the season. ,2
1627,"Oklahoma City come into this game on the back of a good away victory against the Orlando Magic. Dennis Schroder had the hot hand in that game and I expect to see Schroder playing at a high level against his former team. Atlanta won their last game against the Clippers in Georgia in a game where both teams were significantly under-manned. The Hawks relied on a strong game from John Collins, the Wake Forest forward, to push them past one of the better teams in the league. In that game, Atlanta were without Trae Young but Young will play against Oklahoma City as an All-Star for the first time in his career. Young comes back to the state of his birth as a certified baller and will look to put on a show in front of the crowd he was part of during the halcyon days of Westbrook and Durant. ",3

1644,Oklahoma City play against Atlanta tonight who are one of the worst teams in the league.  The Thunder have done really well of late and the team’s record since Thanksgiving stands at 20-8. That is a seriously impressive mark for a team that many of the NBA’s national media thought would miss the play-offs at the start of the season. ,2
1645,"Oklahoma City come into this game on the back of a good away victory against the Orlando Magic. Dennis Schroder had the hot hand in that game and I expect to see Schroder playing at a high level against his former team. Atlanta won their last game against the Clippers in Georgia in a game where both teams were significantly under-manned. The Hawks relied on a strong game from John Collins, the Wake Forest forward, to push them past one of the better teams in the league. In that game, Atlanta were without Trae Young but Young will play against Oklahoma City as an All-Star for the first time in his career. Young comes back to the state of his birth as a certified baller and will look to put on a show in front of the crowd he was part of during the halcyon days of Westbrook and Durant. ",3

1675,"The Thunder (-589) are the second-biggest moneyline favorites on Friday's NBA slate as they take on an injury-ravaged Hawks (+425) side. Atlanta is already last in the Eastern Conference and ill-prepared to handle multiple injuries for any length of time. The Hawks did pull off a 102-95 upset of the Los Angeles Clippers Wednesday, but they had previously lost six of eight games and are just 5-18 on the road for the season.",15
1676,"The Thunder have won three straight games, last beating the Orlando Magic 120-114 Wednesday. They're 6-4 across their last 10 contests and 14-9 at home this season.",16
1677,"Oklahoma City is the easy choice Friday, but AVOID placing a bet on the chalky moneyline odds. A $10 bet returns a profit of just $1.70.",17
1678,"Get action on the THUNDER (-10.5, -115) by backing them to win by at least 11 points. They're 30-15 against the spread overall and 13-10 on home court, while the Hawks are 21-24 ATS overall and just 8-15 on the road. Both teams last played Wednesday, and the Hawks are just 9-15 ATS when playing on equal rest as their opponent. The Thunder are 16-9 ATS in those situations.",18
1679,"Back the UNDER 226.5 (-129). The Thunder average 109.9 points per game and they'll be able to top that figure against the depleted Hawks lineup, but Atlanta is unlikely to fill its share of the projected point total. Siding with the Thunder to win in blowout fashion, the Under is the suitable complementary play.",19

1713,"There was NBA-wide speculation that the Oklahoma City Thunder would act as sellers this trade deadline and garner assets to “retool” or perhaps even rebuild. But instead, given an unexpected different set of circumstances, the team decided to stay the course and keep their core intact. Was that the right decision?",2
1714,"Entering the season, it was widely believed that the Thunder may look to shed Chris Paul and his lucrative contract to a contender. His name was repeatedly thrown around the trade block with numerous blogs playing the role of general manager, constructing hypothetical packages through the season. However, their efforts thus far have been all for naught. The now-10-time NBA All-Star is still a member of the Oklahoma City Thunder with his market never really gaining ground.",3
1715,"Steven Adams was also no stranger to trade speculation, as his services could have aided a contender in a short-sighted “win now” mode. Ironically enough, he was heavily linked with the Atlanta Hawks—who opted instead to deal with the Houston Rockets for the services of Clint Capela and reacquired a familiar face in Dewayne Dedmon.",4
1716,"Then there were also rumors surrounding Dennis Schroder and the Los Angeles Lakers. However, they never really got their boots off the ground.",5
1717,"The Lakers inquired about Dennis Schröder as they look to fortify the PG position leading up to the trade deadline, sources told ESPN. The conversation did not go very far, as OKC — currently the No. 7 seed in the West — were not looking to move him without a hefty return.",6

1719,,8
1720,"Entering this Thursday’s deadline, discussion around Danilo Gallinari and his $22,615,559 expiring contract was what really had momentum. Pat Riley and the Miami Heat had their eyes on Gallo, and when that happens…you often end up in a Heat uniform. But the logistics of the trade were too much to overcome.",9
1721,"Pat Riley clearly sees an opportunity to make a run with these Heat: Riley has been working to trade for Memphis' Andre Iguodala AND Oklahoma City's Danilo Gallinari, league sources tell ESPN. Talks are ongoing.",10
1722,"— Adrian Wojnarowski (@wojespn) February 6, 2020",11
1723,,12
1724,"So, despite some doses of anxiety overwhelming fans of the franchise who pondered what a return package might look like with Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN informing the Twittersphere that Miami had intentions of acquiring Gallinari, nothing materialized. This also means Sam Presti did not make a deal for the sole sake of making one—something that other GMs often fall victim to. It’s good news, it is.",13
1725,"Likewise, it’s also welcoming to see the Oklahoma City Thunder not attempt to duck the tax by jettisoning assets. No need to reopen old wounds there.",14

1739,"When Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN shook the NBA Twittersphere to its very core with the announcement of Paul George‘s trade to the LA Clippers last summer, it altered the league’s hierarchy. For fans of the franchise, it meant a new era of Thunder basketball was set to take form.",3

1744,"But again, here we are, in the first week of February and the Thunder are 10 games above .500 sporting a 30-20 record. Chris Paul was named an NBA All-Star for the 10th time, and the team is on pace for 49 wins—the same amount they had a season ago.",8

1747,"No one in the league has been better in clutch time this season. With five minutes left in regulation or OT, with a five-point differential in the scoreboard, Paul has been at his best. He’s scored 118 points in ‘clutch’ time (most in the NBA) on an efficient 54.2 percent shooting.",11
1748,"Fun fact: The end-game three-headed monster that is Dennis Schroder, Gilgeous-Alexander, and Chris Paul are all shooting above 50 percent in clutch scenarios.

In fact, the backcourt pairing of SGA and CP3 has benefitted both parties…tremendously.

The trade deadline passing and the whole roster staying together will be a big part of the performances improving, the uncertainty regarding trades is out of sight until the off-season.

1794,"Rebuild - Detroit have trundled through mediocrity and first-round exists over the last few season. The owner, Tom Gores, has made play-off basketball a priority because of the additional revenue which it brings to a franchise, it is one of the reasons why Detroit have made so many win-now moves in the recent past. Finally, the Pistons are ready to embrace the rebuild and they have started the rebuild by dealing Andre Drummond. Drummond has been the franchise for the last seven years but will now playing for the Cleveland Cavaliers. Detroit got Brandon Knight, John Henson and a second round pick in return for Andre Drummond, a former All-Star. It is a small return for Andre but it does make sense, Drummond has made it clear that he intends to test free agency this summer, he is a rental for the Cavs. From the Cleveland side of the deal, it does not seem to make sense. Cleveland are in the middle of a slow rebuilding process where Tristan Thompson and Kevin Love will both likely leave in the summer. Andre does not fit the rebuilding timeline on which John Beilein is operating on.",6

1811,Pistons’ Points:,5
1812,"Rebuild - Detroit have trundled through mediocrity and first-round exists over the last few season. The owner, Tom Gores, has made play-off basketball a priority because of the additional revenue which it brings to a franchise, it is one of the reasons why Detroit have made so many win-now moves in the recent past. Finally, the Pistons are ready to embrace the rebuild and they have started the rebuild by dealing Andre Drummond. Drummond has been the franchise for the last seven years but will now playing for the Cleveland Cavaliers. Detroit got Brandon Knight, John Henson and a second round pick in return for Andre Drummond, a former All-Star. It is a small return for Andre but it does make sense, Drummond has made it clear that he intends to test free agency this summer, he is a rental for the Cavs. From the Cleveland side of the deal, it does not seem to make sense. Cleveland are in the middle of a slow rebuilding process where Tristan Thompson and Kevin Love will both likely leave in the summer. Andre does not fit the rebuilding timeline on which John Beilein is operating on.",6

1842,"Reggie Jackson had 28 points and Christian Wood 27 points — one off his career high — and added 12 rebounds and five assists in a starting role. Thon Maker added 19 points and seven rebounds for the Pistons (19-35), who finish a back-to-back at home Saturday against the New York Knicks.",18
1843,"The Pistons were without Derrick Rose, Markieff Morris and Svi Mykhailiuk because of injuries and with Drummond gone and Tim Frazier waived, they had just nine active players. Regardless, the scrappy effort still was there.",19
1844,"“I was really excited about the intensity guys played with; I thought they played hard. You’ve got to execute down the stretch and we didn’t do a good job of executing,” Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. “Some of that is a lot of guys haven’t been in those situations. The effort and intensity was there, for the most part, in the game.”",20
1845,"BOX SCORE: Thunder 108, Pistons 101",21
1846,"The Thunder (32-20) had a 12-point lead early in the fourth quarter after a three-point play and drive by Dennis Schroder (18 points) but Jackson countered with a three-point play and on the next trip, added a four-point play after a jumper by Chris Paul (20 points, six rebounds and seven assists), cutting the lead to 85-78 at the 10:08 mark.",22
1847,"Wood later added a 3-pointer, but Shai Gilgeous-Alexander responded with three of four free throws, en route to five straight Thunder points. Jackson followed with a 3-pointer, but Steven Adams dominated the middle, with 16 points and eight rebounds, getting position on Wood and Maker, who fouled out.",23

1849,Adams hit a hook with 4:23 left to push the lead back to 10.,25
1850,"“That’s where Steven Adams abuses a lot of people in the paint with his size and physicality,” Casey said. “Thon battled and got in front of him a couple times and took away his catches.”",26
1851,"The Pistons rallied with a free throw by Jackson and Wood scored on a putback. That started an 8-2 run, with another lay-in on a nice pick-and-roll play from Jackson and Maker made one of two free throws to finish the flurry, to get within 99-95 with 2:28 left.",27
1852,"The Pistons couldn’t get stops down the stretch, though, and Paul hit two free throws and a jumper to get the lead back to eight. The Thunder lead got down to five in the final seconds, but they made their free throws and kept the Pistons at bay.",28
1853,"With the increased role, Wood flourished, nearing career highs in both points and rebounds, and went 10-of-18 from the field.",29
1854,"“It’s what I conditioned for and worked for. It’s my time and I’m going to give it everything I’ve got,” Wood said. “Just with more games and more experience, it’s starting to come to me. The game is starting to me instead of me chasing it.”",30

1857,"►Instead of choosing between Wood and Maker for a starting center, Casey utilized them both, with Wood at power forward. With no other centers on the roster, the Pistons had to stagger the minutes, with Sekou Doumbouya as the power forward, about the midway point of the first quarter. With only nine players available, the Pistons did well to shuffle the rotation and keep everyone fresh.",33
1858,►Rookie two-way players Jordan Bone and Louis King got some playing time because of the short-handed rotation. Both were scoreless on 0-for-2 shooting. Bone got three fouls in about a four-minute span and both seemed to be logging minutes without hurting the team with bad shots or turnovers.,34
1859,"►Jackson had one of his best games offensively, going 11-of-18 from the field, and was one of the Pistons' best options, but Galloway was just 2-of-8 — and 0-of-5 from 3-point range — and the bench provided just 14 points.",35

1863,"INDIANAPOLIS, IN - NOVEMBER 12: Nerlens Noel #9 of the Oklahoma City Thunder looks on against the ... [+] Indiana Pacers during a game at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on November 12, 2019 in Indianapolis, Indiana. The Pacers defeated the Thunder 111-85.

1864,“I told him I have a unique gift to get big guys the ball.” Chris Paul sat down with Nerlens Noel to talk hoops early in the season and the rest is history. ,2
1865,"After a rough start to his career, Nerlens Noel needed a fresh start. Playing just one season of college basketball at Kentucky, Noel was drafted sixth overall by the Philadelphia 76ers in the 2013 NBA Draft after an ACL injury late in the season made his draft stock fall. ",3
1866,"After just over two seasons in Philadelphia, struggling to fit in, he was traded to the Dallas Mavericks at the trade deadline. With his rookie contract coming to an end, Dallas felt that Noel was worth the risk and hoped a fresh start would rejuvenate his career prior to signing him long-term. ",4
1867,"In the summer of 2017, Noel shockingly turned down a four-year, $70 million contract with Dallas. Instead, he signed a 4.1 million qualifying offer with them instead, making him a free agent the following summer. ",5
1868,"When that next summer came around, the Oklahoma City Thunder would be the next team to give Noel a fresh start. He is now in his second season with the team, earning the minimum in both seasons since. ",6
1869,"After playing with Russell Westbrook for a season, many were curious how a guy like Noel would perform with a player like Chris Paul. So far, it’s been great and their chemistry has been excellent from the beginning. Paul is known for making it easy on big men to have productive seasons, including guys like Tyson Chandler, David West, Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan, and Clint Capela",7
1870,"Just last week, when asked how you develop on-court chemistry with a big man you’ve never played with before, like Nerlens, Chris Paul had a great answer. “There was a conversation early in the season with Nerlens, our lockers are right next to each other. I told him I have a unique gift to get big guys the ball. I told him screen for me and I’ll get it to you. It’s been effortless. Nerlens is a guy that he’s so selfless, he does whatever the team needs him to do night in and night out. It’s nice to reward him.”",8
1871,"It’s been clear that Paul and Noel have had chemistry this season. Their pick-and-roll game has been efficient and they feed off of each other on the defensive end. Paul’s overall leadership on and off the floor has helped young guys, like Noel, have breakout seasons. ",9
1872,How good has Nerlens Noel been with Chris Paul at the helm this season?,10
1873,"In 39 games played this season, Noel has started in six games during the absence of Steven Adams. While the 8.2 points per game he is producing is by no means a career-high, the way he he doing it extremely efficient, producing those points on only 4.8 shots per contest. Noel is also giving the Thunder 5.3 rebounds, 1.6 blocks, and 1.0 steals per game, doing a bit of everything. ",11
1874,"Speaking of efficiency, Noel is shooting 80.5 percent from the free throw line as well as 67.7 percent from the field. Both of these are career-high marks for him and his field goal percentage is good for 12th in the entire NBA. Another career-high for Noel is his 71.8 true shooting percentage, which is the highest on the team and 11th in the league. ",12
1875,"All of this production out of Nerlens is great, but what is even more impressive is that he does all of this in just 18.9 minutes per game. When it comes to usage percentage on the Thunder, he is 13th, showing just how efficient he is. ",13
1876,"When looking at Noel’s per 36 numbers, he starts to really stand out among not only Thunder players, but all players in the NBA. His 15.5 points per 36 minutes are fifth on the Thunder, one spot over Steven Adams. On top of this, Noel is 12th on the team in field goal attempts per 36 minutes, meaning he makes every shot count. His rebounds are second on the team to only Adams with 10.1 per 36 minutes.",14
1877,"Defensively, where Noel thrives, he blows everyone on the team out of the water. Per 36 minutes, he produces 3.0 blocks (1st on team, 11th in NBA) and 1.9 steals (1st on team, 17th in NBA). Overall, his .244 win share per 36 minutes is best on the team by far and 11th in the NBA. ",15
1878,"Overall, when you look at efficiency and metrics per 36 minutes, Nerlens Noel looks better than Steven Adams on paper. That’s extremely impressive considering he is making 7.85 percent of the money Adams is making in the 2019-20 season. ",16
1879,"Noel has been an exceptional spark off the bench for Oklahoma City. In fact, he’s been one of the best centers off the bench in entire league this season. His 23.0 player efficiency rating (PER) is 25th in the entire NBA. How impressive is that? Well, his PER is higher than guys like Russell Westbrook, Donovan Mitchell, Andre Drummond, Bam Adebayo, Bradley Beal, and obviously many others. ",17
1880,"While Nerlens Noel’s statistics at first glance don’t jump off the page, when looking at how efficiently he produces for the Oklahoma City Thunder, it’s extremely impressive. His production on both ends of the court off the bench this season has not gone unnoticed. ",18
1881,"Chris Paul has overall been a huge part of Nerlens Noel’s breakout season. Having a Hall of Fame, pass-first point guard has been exactly what a guy like Noel has needed to get his career back on track and earn another payday. He left a lot of money on the table after turning down $70 million from Dallas, but will look to make some of that up with his great play this season earning him a lucrative, long-term deal.",19

2029,"After squashing the Portland Trail Blazers by a score of 138-117 and grabbing what could become a deciding tiebreaker if these two teams finish in a tie in the regular season standings, the New Orleans Pelicans are in the midst of streaking to a great finish right before the 2020 All-Star break. Only one obstacle remains in the way of tying a season-high of four wins in a row before the week lay-off in play: the Oklahoma City Thunder.",2
2030,"The Thunder have been an unsolved riddle this season, having won all three meetings against the Pelicans to date. While the likelihood of catching OKC in the Western Conference is slim to none (they’re 9 games ahead and sitting comfortably inside the postseason picture), it is important to salvage the season series with a win on Thursday evening. Only 28 contests remain on the schedule and New Orleans must still leap frog three teams to jump into that final playoff spot. So, piling up as many wins as possible is the name of the game.",3
2031,"Before the start of this season, Chris Paul was left for dead. Oh, many still considered him a useful player who could give a playoff contender some extra oomph, but few believed that he remained capable of leading a team to the postseason. In his 15th season, Paul is averaging 17.5 points, 6.6 assists, 5.0 rebounds and 1.6 steals. He’s not OKC’s leading scorer (three other Thunder are averaging 19+ points), but he’s the engine — and opponents have had a front row seat to his heady exploits.",4

2033,"Although he’s only averaging 12.7 points in the three contests against the Pelicans, Paul has posted a team-best 9.3 +/-. Paul is fantastic at finding the seams in opposing defenses, and if he can’t find an open shot, he’s done a great job of creating one for Danilo Gallinari on the wing or Steven Adams in the paint. In turn, with the primary focus on Paul, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Dennis Schroder have thrived in secondary attacking roles.",6
2034,"It’s a tall ask to beat a team that seemingly has your number, but the New Orleans Pelicans would like nothing more than to enter the All-Star break riding a wave of momentum because it can lead to great things. Two years ago, the Pelicans won three straight games before the 2018 All-Star game. They then proceeded to win seven consecutive contests out of the break too, propelling them to an exciting run that didn’t end until the second round of the 2017-18 playoffs.",7

Something switched in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s eyes on that frigid January night in Minneapolis. Two nights before, the Thunder lost at home to the Lakers after getting hopelessly outrebounded, resulting in 28 second-chance points for Los Angeles and a 15-point loss for OKC. In the locker room postgame, SGA took part of the responsibility for the 54-37 disparity on the glass. Although he tallied 24 points, he felt like he should have helped his big men more.
 
 
The next game in Minnesota, he exploded for 20 points, 20 rebounds and 10 assists. It marked his first career triple-double and made him the youngest player ever to accomplish such a stat line.
 
 
“Honestly, coach just challenged me before the game­,” said Gilgeous-Alexander, who was interrupted during his post-game walk-off interview by his fellow point guard, Dennis Schröder. ",2
2043," Keep rising, SGA! ",3
2044,"A post shared by  Oklahoma City Thunder (@okcthunder) on Jan 31, 2020 at 9:23am PST",4
2045,"
 
Schröder poked his head over the shoulder of the 6-foot-6 Gilgeous-Alexander. He then held out his hand as if to try to calculate how a 20-point, 20-rebound, 10-assist game was even feasible. ""Twenty, twenty and 10, bro?!” Schröder asked rhetorically, shaking his head. “That’s so tough, bro! Oh my god!”
 
 
At that, SGA smiled wide and dapped up the Thunder’s sixth man and shot back, “Twenty, twenty, twenty is next.” Schröder then proudly slapped his teammate on the chest and walked away. The smile melted from Gilgeous-Alexander’s face as he returned to answering the question Thunder broadcast reporter Nick Gallo just asked him. Back to business.
 
 
The sophomore guard could only respond to one more question before Schröder returned seemingly out of nowhere. This time, with two open water bottles in tow. He emptied them over the head of SGA, who retreated so as to avoid the cold celebratory shower. 
 
 
Not one to bathe in the spotlight, Gilgeous-Alexander returned to the microphone pointed in his direction. With water dripping from his hair and face, he picked up right where he left off, his attention locked on the interview at hand.",5
2046,"
Gilgeous-Alexander credits his mom and former Olympian, Charmaine Gilgeous, for keeping his ego in check while he grows in his role of representing Canada.
 
 
The Hamilton, Ontario, native quickly grew into the spotlight as a rising star in the NBA landscape. After playing all 82 games in his rookie campaign with the LA Clippers, Gilgeous-Alexander has increased nearly all of his statistics with the Thunder as he took on a more prominent offensive role. He’s averaging 19.6 points, 6.1 rebounds and three assists on 46.2 percent shooting from the field.
 
 
“She tells me I suck every day,” Gilgeous-Alexander said jokingly of his mom.
 
 
One month prior to his historic triple-double game, he was in his hometown of Toronto as his team took on the reigning NBA champions. For only the second time in his career, Gilgeous-Alexander played on the court he once sat in the stands and admired as a kid. When the Ontario native thought back, he couldn’t remember any distinct players or memories from his visits to Scotia Bank Arena growing up, he just remembered the feeling and the vibrance of the crowd.
 
 
“I wouldn’t say I have any specific memories. It was just always special going to the game and seeing the guys on the floor and feeling the electricity in the arena,” said Gilgeous-Alexander.
 
 
However, when he stepped into Scotia Bank Arena in late December, it would be his performance and his name that the Canadian kids in the stands would be looking up to. Not many Toronto natives made a name for themselves in the NBA, but the second-year standout is determined to change that, especially with the recent rise in Canadian talent in the league this season. This includes his cousin, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Knicks rookie R.J. Barrett and Raptors rookie, two-way player Oshae Brissett, another Toronto native who played with SGA in the U16 Canadian FIBA team.
 
 
“Anything is possible with hard work and determination. That’s something I tell kids all the time when they ask questions. If you put your mind to it and you’re willing to work for it you can get it and we’re living proof of that,” Gilgeous-Alexander said. 
 
 
In that game, SGA put on a performance nobody in Canada would soon forget. After going off for a remarkable 20 points in the first half, the Thunder guard banked in the game-winning bucket and tied his career-high of 32 points. Although it was the third time that SGA reached the 32-point mark, when he did it in Toronto, he went down in the record books. His performance marked the most points any Canadian has ever had against the Raptors.

 
This performance comes nearly one year after Gilgeous-Alexander’s rookie debut in Toronto. In that game, the Clippers lost but the then-rookie put up 19 points. Little did he know his performance would be overwhelmingly eclipsed in 12 months’ time.

 
“It feels good but all of it honestly wouldn’t have meant anything if we didn’t win and that was the best feeling knowing that we came out of here with the win,” said Gilgeous-Alexander.
 
 
In the second quarter of the game, while both teams were locked in on their respective huddles during a timeout, attention in the arena locked on the jumbotron. A dedication to Canada natives Gilgeous-Alexander and his teammate, Montreal native Luguentz Dort, played for all to see. Highlights of the duo’s FIBA performances flashed across the screen with the title “Homegrown Heroes” headlining the entire tribute. When the montage concluded, the Raptors’ public address announcer punctuated the moment by adding, “Thank you for representing the North. Canada is proud of you.”
 
 
What followed was a chorus of applause. To Thunder Head Coach Billy Donovan, the warm reception was less about the high-level basketball and more about the high-level character his Canadian guards possess.
 
 
“Shai’s a great kid and I almost feel like because it’s early in his career, people probably know who he is as a person and it’s probably been well-documented on who he is as a guy. Everybody knows that he’s a talented player,” said Donovan.
 
 
“I think the applause was for how he’s represented Canada as a person. I thought that was a great tribute to him because he’s a quality kid and deserves it and he’s represented his country very, very well and he’s represented us very, very well.”
",6
2047,"
Donovan praises Gilgeous-Alexander’s humility and willingness to learn. His sponge-like ability to soak up knowledge and learn from experiences has allowed SGA to progress at a high rate in his second season. As a result, the Thunder coaching staff has pushed him to grow in areas beyond scoring and impact the game in ways very few players can.

 
“He is so gifted in my opinion and so smart and so cerebral that there are other ways he can impact the game,” said Donovan. “He can impact the game by rebounding, he can impact the game with his assists, he can impact the game by penetrating, and enduring help and kicking out…”
 
 
As a result, when his team lost to the Lakers because of rebounding, the second-year standout took on the personal challenge of making his presence known in multiple categories on the stat sheet in the Thunder’s next game. What culminated was a historic and remarkable triple-double and of course, a win.
 
 
Surrounded by a swarm of both Canadian and American media outlets postgame in Toronto, SGA stood in front of the OKC Thunder backdrop and fielded questions about his game-high, record breaking, game-winning performance in his hometown. The son of Charmaine Gilgeous remained humble as ever.
 
 
“I feel like I’ve gotten better in the summertime and in the beginning of the season, and I’m just trying to continue it.”

 
As for his mom’s approval, the sophomore shrugged and dared to venture, “She might be satisfied.” 
 
 
 
The second-year Kentucky product will now represent both the Thunder and Canada in his second Rising Stars Game during All-Star weekend. Outside of Gilgeous-Alexander, four other Canadians will take the stage on the World team including his cousin Nickeil Alexander-Walker, R.J. Barret and Brandon Clarke. The 26th Rising Stars Game will be televised on TNT Friday, Feb. 14 at 8 p.m. CT. ",7

His performance marked the most points any Canadian has ever had against the Raptors.

 
This performance comes nearly one year after Gilgeous-Alexander’s rookie debut in Toronto. In that game, the Clippers lost but the then-rookie put up 19 points. Little did he know his performance would be overwhelmingly eclipsed in 12 months’ time.

 
“It feels good but all of it honestly wouldn’t have meant anything if we didn’t win and that was the best feeling knowing that we came out of here with the win,” said Gilgeous-Alexander.
 
 
In the second quarter of the game, while both teams were locked in on their respective huddles during a timeout, attention in the arena locked on the jumbotron. A dedication to Canada natives Gilgeous-Alexander and his teammate, Montreal native Luguentz Dort, played for all to see. Highlights of the duo’s FIBA performances flashed across the screen with the title “Homegrown Heroes” headlining the entire tribute. When the montage concluded, the Raptors’ public address announcer punctuated the moment by adding, “Thank you for representing the North. Canada is proud of you.”
 
 
What followed was a chorus of applause. To Thunder Head Coach Billy Donovan, the warm reception was less about the high-level basketball and more about the high-level character his Canadian guards possess.
 
 
“Shai’s a great kid and I almost feel like because it’s early in his career, people probably know who he is as a person and it’s probably been well-documented on who he is as a guy. Everybody knows that he’s a talented player,” said Donovan.
 
 
“I think the applause was for how he’s represented Canada as a person. I thought that was a great tribute to him because he’s a quality kid and deserves it and he’s represented his country very, very well and he’s represented us very, very well.”

Donovan praises Gilgeous-Alexander’s humility and willingness to learn. His sponge-like ability to soak up knowledge and learn from experiences has allowed SGA to progress at a high rate in his second season. As a result, the Thunder coaching staff has pushed him to grow in areas beyond scoring and impact the game in ways very few players can.

 
“He is so gifted in my opinion and so smart and so cerebral that there are other ways he can impact the game,” said Donovan. “He can impact the game by rebounding, he can impact the game with his assists, he can impact the game by penetrating, and enduring help and kicking out…”
 
 
As a result, when his team lost to the Lakers because of rebounding, the second-year standout took on the personal challenge of making his presence known in multiple categories on the stat sheet in the Thunder’s next game. What culminated was a historic and remarkable triple-double and of course, a win.
 
 
Surrounded by a swarm of both Canadian and American media outlets postgame in Toronto, SGA stood in front of the OKC Thunder backdrop and fielded questions about his game-high, record breaking, game-winning performance in his hometown. The son of Charmaine Gilgeous remained humble as ever.
 
 
“I feel like I’ve gotten better in the summertime and in the beginning of the season, and I’m just trying to continue it.”

 
As for his mom’s approval, the sophomore shrugged and dared to venture, “She might be satisfied.” 
 
 
 
The second-year Kentucky product will now represent both the Thunder and Canada in his second Rising Stars Game during All-Star weekend. Outside of Gilgeous-Alexander, four other Canadians will take the stage on the World team including his cousin Nickeil Alexander-Walker, R.J. Barret and Brandon Clarke. The 26th Rising Stars Game will be televised on TNT Friday, Feb. 14 at 8 p.m. CT. ",7

NOTE: During the month of February, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution will publish a daily feature highlighting African American contributions to our state and nation. This is the fifth year of the AJC Sepia Black History Month series. In addition to the daily feature, the AJC also will publish deeper examinations of contemporary African American life each Sunday.

2796,"The odyssey of black people in the United States began 400 years ago with the arrival of slaves from West Africa. With that kind of introduction, the relationship with this country has often been controversial, but still relevant. So how do you accurately incorporate that history into lessons that teach students what shaped this country’s past and has lasting effects on its future?",2
2797,Frederick Knight is a history professor at Morehouse College. He specializes in the African Diaspora and agreed that it can be tricky distinguishing fact from fiction in the history of a race that rarely was allowed to chronicle its own stories.,3
2798,"“Especially in K through 12 education it’s important to provide doses of truth and allow the students to make their own discoveries,” he said. “That sets them up to be lifelong learners who cross-check facts and don’t accept everything at face value.”",4
2799,"Knight published the book, “Working the Diaspora: The Impact of African Labor on the Anglo-American World, 1650-1850,” in 2010. He argues that the knowledge that Africans carried across the Atlantic shaped Anglo-American agricultural development and made particularly important contributions to cotton, indigo, tobacco, and staple food cultivation.",5
2800,"Even though they didn’t come of their own free will, the African slaves contributed a lot to this country and that’s a huge takeaway for understanding black history, Knight said. He challenges Americans to alter their conceptual frameworks about Africans by looking at them as workers who, through the course of the Atlantic slave trade and plantation labor, shaped the development of the Americas in significant ways.",6
2801,"How to frame slavery is an issue educators in kindergarten through high school have wrestled with for decades. Southern states like Georgia, the home of Martin Luther King Jr., have it especially tough. In the age of Confederate revisionism, mixed views on President Trump and calls for reparations for slavery, and after the first black president, Georgia has education standards that incorporate black people in just about every aspect of history.",7
2802,"“These standards were created by teachers across the state, education leaders, curriculum directors and stakeholders,” said Joy Hatcher, social studies program manager for the Georgia Department of Education.",8
2803,The curriculum is evaluated every four to eight years to add new information and reflect educational standards. That last revision for social studies was completed in June 2016 for the 2017-2018 school year.,9
2804,"And although educators can’t pretend certain things didn’t happen, they aim to put lessons into age-appropriate context. For example, the story of Ruby Bridges talks about integration and civil rights from the perspective of a schoolgirl.",10
2805,"“We provide sample units and lessons that meet state standards as well as support and other resources for teachers,” said Hatcher.",11
2806,"The Georgia Standards of Excellence for Social Studies integrates the history of African Americans throughout the school year, K-12. Although there are GSE standards that address black history K-12, courses such as United States history and Georgia studies specifically address this subject.",12
2807,"Schools use the month of February to spotlight historical figures. According to a Cobb County Public Schools spokesman, the social studies department will share a black history resource guide with schools and support local school events.",13
2808,"Clayton County Public Schools allows students to dive deeper into the legacy of African Americans in the United States. Over the years, in addition to providing teachers with a variety of lesson plans that allow them to select engaging topics, schools have been provided with a list of places relative to African-American History that can be visited as class field trips or with guardians over the weekend.",14
2809,"

",15
2810,"Fulton County does not mandate how schools recognize Black History Month, but encourages platforms for rich discussion among students — hosting an array of special events such as musicals and dramatic performances, inviting guest speakers, and holding competitions such as door decorations and cafeteria trivia.",16
2811,"Cherokee County’s eighth-grade Georgia history curriculum includes lessons on African Americans’ accomplishments and contributions — historical, political, social, and economic. An example of one way to do this is a scavenger hunt for students involving quotes from notable figures from black history posted on the walls throughout the school. Students create a timeline of black history from the quotes.",17
2812,"While many in the black community applaud those efforts, some aren’t sure they’re enough. They argue that to effectively teach black history, black people must take control of their own narrative and ensure that it’s not just about looking back, but mainly looking forward. In doing so, we can’t forget our humanity, many implore.",18
2813,"Janice Bell, a paraprofessional at a day care center near Emory University and the CDC, was one of the first black children to integrate a white school in Daytona Beach, Fla.",19
2814,"“At 8 years old, I was assigned to South Ridgewood Elementary. It was the first elementary school in Volusia County to accept black students. I had a reading disability so they asked my mother if I could attend South Daytona Elementary — which had no blacks at all. My mother agreed because the wheels of change had already started moving.”",20
2815,Bell said she had no trouble.,21
2816,"“I think it’s mainly because racism has to be taught. Some of the kids were curious about me, but nobody bullied me or called me names,” she said. “That’s how it is at my school here in Atlanta. We have such diversity that nobody focuses on the differences. Even though they are little ones, they know everyone’s not the same.”",22
2817,"Darius Hicks, producer of the podcast “While Black,” moved to metro Atlanta from Mississippi. He found that the best education was only in predominantly white areas and that perception carried over in his decision where to locate here.",23
2818,"“When you look at an educational system that is predominately black you think, ‘I’m not sending my kids there!’ ” he said. “But after getting to know what’s available and taking a better look at several communities, I know that’s not the case.”",24
2819,"With many school districts now majority minority and others headed in that direction, educators have become more cognizant of cultural differences. He created the podcast a few years ago to challenge the current narrative about blacks.",25
2820,"“We are often seen as scary to white Americans,” he said. “But when you look at the majority of us, we go to work every day, pay our taxes, try to raise our kids and live a great life. We want the same things everyone else wants. Somewhere along the way, somebody else defined us and it’s time for us to set the definition straight.”",26
2821,He set up a series for Black History Month titled “Black Future.” Each week will pay homage to history by looking at what’s coming next.,27
2822,"
“We don’t have to rely on others to tell our stories. We have the tools and the skills to use those tools.” —Kellye Britton, director of operations and programming for the Harvard Debate Council Diversity Project
",28
2823,"The first installment will feature Kellye Britton, director of operations and programming for the Harvard Debate Council Diversity Project. The program promotes educational equity by creating opportunities for underserved youth to gain exposure and access to academic training that will distinguish them as top candidates in the college admissions process. She explains on the podcast how to invest in youth and how to create standards of excellence.",29
2824,"“I’m blown away on almost a daily basis with how many gifted and talented young people we have,” she said. “But potential isn’t enough. We have to work to hone those skills and give them opportunities to excel.”",30
2825,"In her role with the Harvard debate project, she encourages students to find solutions to issues on their own. Before the students become great debaters, they must be great thinkers, she said.",31
2826,"“That’s how we ensure that our history is OUR history,” she said. “We don’t have to rely on others to tell our stories. We have the tools and the skills to use those tools.”",32
2827,She gave an example of a time in her academic career where she chose to take control of her narrative.,33
2828,"“In school I was often the only minority in most classes,” she said. “In a literature and writing class we were given the opportunity to write papers on books of our choosing. … I did my 10th grade thesis on ‘Waiting to Exhale.’ ”",34
2829,"She added that she gradually realized she didn’t have to hide behind a veil of ‘being black.’ It was obvious to people who and what she was. So, unapologetically, she delved into her history and culture.",35
2830,"“I not only made an A in the class,” she said. “I made the highest grade that instructor had ever awarded. And I stayed true to self.”",36
2831,"Hicks’ son Isaiah, who is a member of the current Harvard Debate Council Diversity Project group, is producing this series.",37
2832,"“He’s doing it all — booking the guests, setting up topics and questions, editing the raw audio,” said Hicks.",38
2833,"HDCDP alumni Payton Gunner and Xavier Shankle are guests on the second installment of the podcast. Their topic centers around respect for past black history pioneers and moving the narrative forward. And in the final two episodes, those scholars will take over as hosts.",39
2834,"“All four episodes are about youth, through youth and for youth,” said Hicks. “At the same time, however, we have to enlighten everyone else, especially white people. They shouldn’t be surprised by our accomplishments. And we should speak as loud — no louder — about those than we do about the negative stuff.”",40
2835,"Author Curtis Claytor agrees that knowledge is power. In the good old days, families used to gather on the porch in the evenings and tell stories about the past. Today’s kids know little about their own families, much less pioneers who paved the way for them.",41
2836,"In “The Ultimate Black History Trivia Book” Claytor included 2,000 multiple-choice questions and answers in four categories: history, music, sports and television, arts and literature.",42
2837,"“Most of us learn in school about Martin Luther King, Jr., Harriet Tubman, and George Washington Carver. But who was the woman who refused to sit in the Jim Crow section of a train in 1883 or the black man who invented the gas mask and the three-signal stoplight?” said Claytor.",43
2838,"He said it’s important to learn about inventors and the heroes of the black struggle, but also about about the horrific racial violence that is seldom mentioned in history books.",44
2839,"“Do you know about the race riot that resulted in the murder of over 200 blacks and the destruction of more than 1,100 black businesses and homes?” he asked. Few Americans do, he said.",45
2840,"At the end of the day, it’s important that the stories get told, said Knight. “Images matter.”",46

THE SCENE AT Kerr Middle School mirrored that of the NBA combine where aspiring players put their skills to the test ahead of draft night. Reflex drills took place on the sideline while vertical testing and basketball drills took place on opposite ends of the floor.
 
However, there were a few key differences in Tuesday’s combine compared to the one that occurs every May in Chicago: the group was made up entirely of seventh and eighth graders; there was only one NBA player; and the main focus of this combine was character.
 
The one NBA player present was Thunder rookie, Darius Bazley who endured gauntlet of the NBA combine only nine months ago. Bazley roamed through each of the four stations of the character combine offering his expertise on the drills at hand, three of which were dedicated to on-court basketball skills.",2
2864,"
The fourth station however, required no athletic ability at all. As a matter of fact, all it required was a permanent marker and a big dream. Four easels stood in front of the bleachers with the faces of Misty Copeland, Jackie Robinson, Madam C.J. Walker and Oprah Winfrey displayed on each one.
 
When asked what they knew about each one, the young group belted out, “Ballerina!”, “First African American baseball player!”, “She’s a millionaire!”
 
All correct answers, but what they didn’t realize were the small steps each one had to take every day to get to their respective points of recognition. Winfrey grew up in rural Mississippi to a low-income family and with the massive goal in mind to have her own television show, accomplished small victories every single day to help her get to where she is today.
 
“I just think it all correlates because when you look at those people, you always just see their big wins and sometimes you don’t see their little wins,” said Bazley. “I think it’s big for them to see how someone as big as those four people were and realize some of the small things they did to get to where they are.”
 






Each person at the station identified their big win that they wanted to accomplish in life and wrote it down on a massive banner spread on the floor with “Celebrate the Win” inscribed across the top. On the other side of the banner, the group wrote down the small, daily wins that would be necessary to achieve each goal and then connected the line that tied those two goals together.",3
2865,"


“I think that was probably the most impactful thing, especially for young kids because I know when I was younger, I wasn’t learning about little wins that make a big difference,” said Bazley. “Nobody really broke it down like they did so it was pretty cool.”
 
Bazley brought a modern day, tangible take to what small victories might look like. For him, making his bed every day and making sure his house is clean helps him to feel prepared to conquer each day. The group locked their gaze on the rookie as he spoke. As an NBA player, his words resonated with the seventh and eight grade basketball players who have their whole lives ahead of them and big dreams for the taking.
 
“They listen to adults, but when it’s someone like that, they really listen and they really look up to those guys,” said Darcy Budde, Assistant Principal at Kerr Middle School.  “I hope that they take away that they really can do anything they put their minds to.”

When the NBA schedule came out, the Thunder front office, training staff and coaching staff all looked at the month of January and came to a clear conclusion – that 31-day span was going to be an absolute grind.
 
With 17 games in a 30-day span, the Thunder played at least every other day, including three sets of back-to-backs. Even the build-up to the month was unforgiving. Starting on Christmas day, OKC has gone more than five weeks without getting two consecutive days off without a game. Yet despite a relentless amount of basketball and adversity sprinkled in due to injuries, personal reasons and travel, the Thunder not only emerged unscathed, it thrived.
 
The Thunder finished the month 12-5, building on the momentum it established in December when the team went 11-4 and Billy Donovan was named Western Conference Coach of the Month.
 
In December, it was the Thunder defense that did the heavy lifting. In the opening month of 2020, a blistering offense led the way. By averaging 115.0 points on 47.8 percent shooting, including 37.8 percent from three and 82.0 percent from the free-throw line, the Thunder cracked the top 10 in crucial offensive categories. 
 
“Great month,” veteran forward Danilo Gallinari said after the team’s exhilarating 111-107 win over Phoenix on Friday night. “We knew it was a tough month, tough schedule. It’s great that we played this basketball for this month.”




 ",2
2876,"

Added Donovan: “In terms of the competitive spirit these guys have had for the entire month, and the way they’ve played for each other and with each other, it has been really remarkable to watch considering the fact that the month was filled with a lot of different lineups for us because of injuries and guys being out.”
 
As Donovan referenced, the injury bug hit the Thunder harder in January than any other month, yet the team surged ahead unfazed. Terrance Ferguson (personal), Nerlens Noel (ankle) and Abdel Nader (ankle) each missed eight games during the month. That’s three key rotation players missing nearly half of the contests. Meanwhile, Gallinari and Steven Adams each missed three games with nagging injuries and Chris Paul missed the team’s home loss to Dallas due to personal reasons.
 
To compensate, the Thunder didn’t tighten up its rotations and just rely on its usual contributors. Instead, Donovan invested in his depth, reaching to Mike Muscala, Deonte Burton, Hamidou Diallo and rookie two-way guard Lu Dort to not just fill minutes, but to thrive. Muscala made 11 3-pointers in a three-game span and Dort not only took on hefty defensive challenges but also made 10 of- 15 3-point attempts during a 17-quarter stretch towards the end of the month.
 
“It really speaks a lot to the mentality of a lot of these guys and how much they’ve worked and kept themselves prepared and ready,” Donovan said.
 
“We’ve tried to always play to an identity and to a style of how we want to play. Regardless of if somebody is out, someone filling in knows what their job and responsibility is,” he added. “All those things help.”



 ",3
2877,"
EVEN AMONG THE players who have been in the rotation all season long, the Thunder got extra contributions. Second-year guard and All-Star Rising Stars selection Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is the only Thunder player to compete in all 50 games this season and yet, he dug into his energy reserves to take on more responsibility. Starting on Jan. 13, when he registered his first-career triple-double, a 20-point, 20-rebound, 10-assist masterpiece in Minnesota, SGA has gone to extra lengths to emphasize the non-scoring aspects of his game. 
 
Gilgeous-Alexander is averaging a team-high 9.1 rebounds per game during that 11-game span to go with 4.9 assists, 1.2 steals and 1.4 blocks, more than every Thunder player other than Noel.
 
“I’m just trying to do more,” said Gilgeous-Alexander. “At the end of the day, be more of a complete basketball player, whether that’s getting rebounds, assists, points, steals.”
",4
2878,"
LIKE IN MINNESOTA, Gilgeous-Alexander and his Thunder teammates have thrived as much away from home as they have inside Chesapeake Energy Arena. In fact, after starting 0-6 on the road to begin the year, the Thunder is 15-4 since, including 9-1 in January. The month began in San Antonio – a spot where historically teams struggle to go in and simply take care of business. In the second half, that’s exactly what OKC did. That momentum continued to road wins in Cleveland (in a blowout) and Brooklyn (in overtime) to finish that four-game road trip. 
 
Since then, the Thunder beat up on Minnesota twice and swept two other two-game road trips. The first set came against a pair of playoff teams, with the Thunder surging back from 15-down with less than seven minutes to go in Houston to stun the Rockets. Then, in Orlando, the Thunder staved off a furious comeback by the Magic to commence its current stretch of seven wins in its last eight games. After dispatching the Kings by 20 in Sacramento on Wednesday, the Thunder surged ahead with a 13-0 late fourth-quarter run to beat Phoenix on Friday to close the month. 
 
“We just trust each other. We try to play to our identity no matter the circumstances,” Gilgeous-Alexander said. “We just try to control what we can control.”
 
“It just shows growth and understanding that on the road, we have to play together, we have to stick together,” Paul said. “Teams are going to make runs, the crowd is going to be in the game. The confidence that our team has right now when the game is on the line down the stretch is probably at an all-time high.”

 

	
	
 ",5
2879,"
DESPITE BLOWOUT HOME wins against Houston, Orlando and Portland, many of the games last month had a common theme: a tight fourth quarter. Once again, after not thriving in those circumstances early in the year, the Thunder has now turned into one of the scariest teams to be in close combat with in the entire league.
 
In fact, the Thunder outscored its foes by 3.9 points per fourth quarter in the month, the best mark in the league. Paul, the savvy veteran point guard, along with the lightning bolt alongside him in crunch time, Dennis Schröder, have been sensational down the stretch of games. They’ve isolated against big men, hit dagger jumpers in the midrange and from behind the arc and have just generally put the Thunder in positions to win.
 
“We just try to finish,” said Paul, a 2020 All-Star, earning his first selection since the 2015-16 season, “especially when it gets to the four or five-minute mark. We know that’s winning time. That’s when the really good teams lock in.”
 ",6
2880,"
FOR THE MONTH, Schröder averaged 20.4 points on 48.3 percent shooting, including an unreal 46.4 percent from the 3-point line. Meanwhile, Paul notched 5.1 points per fourth quarter in January and 18.3 per game overall in the month.
 
After shouldering a solid amount of the playmaking and defending load over the last month, the Thunder’s three point guards will all be looking forward to a couple days off before revving back up for the month of February. Paul and Schröder will relish spending Saturday and Sunday with their children before the Thunder reconvenes for practice on Monday. With an early morning arrival from Phoenix on Saturday and the Super Bowl on Sunday, Gilgeous-Alexander has set plans as well.
 
“It’ll be good. I won’t be touching a basketball for those two days,” he said, grinning.
 
“Me neither,” Gallinari quipped.

 ",7
2881,"
AFTER 48 HOURS of some peace and quiet, it’ll be back to the Thunder Ion for the beginning of the home stretch. Only 32 games remain, with just 10 in February, giving the Thunder some clear runway to keep sharpening its tools and preparing itself for a late-season run in April and possibly beyond. To do that requires putting in the work. This Thunder squad not only likes being around one another, it also enjoys pulling in the same direction on the court in the short term as investment in itself for the long term.
 
“It’s good to have a couple days off and get back to practice,” Gallinari added, referencing the team’s severe lack of practice time lately. “To spend some time in the gym and practice with each other is going to be nice.”

2900,"In addition to whining about the Nuggets’ offensive inconsistencies, topics include the following:",3
2901,"The Dallas Mavericks have acquired Oklahoma City Thunder big man Justin Patton in a trade, Shams Charania of The Athletic reports. The team desperate for frontcourt depth will take a flyer on the journeyman 22-year-old.",1
2902,Heading to OKC in the swap is rookie forward Isaiah Roby while the Mavs additionally collect cash considerations.,2
2903,The move gives Dallas a big body as they cope with the season-ending loss of Dwight Powell but they may not keep him. Tim Cato of The Athletic writes that the team may cut Patton to free up a roster spot.,3
2904,"While Patton has struggled with his own health issues over the years, he’s averaged 12.1 points and 8.2 rebounds per game in 23 contests with Oklahoma City’s G League affiliate in 2019-20.",4
2905,"If the Mavs choose to waive Patton because his 2020-21 contract year is non-guaranteed, they’d have a roster spot with which to pursue an available free agent. Earlier this week there were reports that the Mavs had reached out to Joakim Noah.",5
2906,"Swapping Patton for Roby will provide the Thunder modest cap relief. Roby’s 2020-21 contract year, however, is guaranteed at $1.5M.",6

2932,"Patton, a 6-foot-11, 240-pound bruiser in his third season in the NBA, appears to be of interest to the Mavericks as a stopgap measure in the wake of losing center Dwight Powell to a ruptured Achilles tendon.",4

2996,"A few weeks ago Kendrick Perkins, once a serviceable NBA center, now an inelegant provocateur, was doing what he does best — building himself up by trying to belittle others. 
Perkins’ profesional zenith was being a strap hanger on the 2007-08 Boston Celtics as they captured the NBA title (beating the Los Angeles Lakers and Kobe Bryant in the Finals). Later, Perkins was a teammate of Kevin Durant for five seasons when the two were in the employ of the Oklahoma City Thunder. Still later, Perkins endeavored to slime the Golden State Warriors of recent vintage, going so far as to accuse them of medical malfeasance for letting Durant return to the court in last June’s NBA Finals. Where, of course, Durant ruptured an Achilles tendon. 
						
More recently Perkins took after Durant on Twitter, anointing Russell Westbrook as the greatest player ever to wear a Thunder uniform. The occasion was Westbrook’s first visit to Oklahoma City since he was dealt to the Houston Rockets last summer. 
Why the finger in Durant’s eye? It seems he disappointed Perkins for leaving the Thunder for the powerhouse Golden State Warriors once upon a time.

Yea and our starting center @KendrickPerkins averaged a whopping 2 and 3 during that series. U played hard tho champ lol 
— Kevin Durant (@KDTrey5) January 10, 2020 

Anyway. 
Here it gets real. It seems Perkins, like all of us, has been shaken by the shocking death of Kobe Bryant, who, as far as we can tell, didn’t waste a day in his life. 

						if ( ""undefined"" !== typeof googletag ) {
							googletag.cmd.push( function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-Cube_Article""); } );
						}
					

Sunday, just hours after the tragedy, Perkins reached out to Durant. 

Just wanted to tell you I Love you my brother and whatever I did to hurt you I’m sorry bro and hope you forgive me!!! I love you bro real Talk! @KDTrey5
— Kendrick Perkins (@KendrickPerkins) January 26, 2020 

Perkins elaborated in an interview with NBC Boston’s Gary Tanguay: 
“I’m not about to let that go another day down the drain behind a B.S. Twitter beef that’s not called for,” Perkins said. “And our brotherhood, our friendship is more valuable.

3021,"A few weeks ago Kendrick Perkins, once a serviceable NBA center, now an inelegant provocateur, was doing what he does best — building himself up by trying to belittle others. 
Perkins’ profesional zenith was being a strap hanger on the 2007-08 Boston Celtics as they captured the NBA title (beating the Los Angeles Lakers and Kobe Bryant in the Finals). Later, Perkins was a teammate of Kevin Durant for five seasons when the two were in the employ of the Oklahoma City Thunder. Still later, Perkins endeavored to slime the Golden State Warriors of recent vintage, going so far as to accuse them of medical malfeasance for letting Durant return to the court in last June’s NBA Finals. Where, of course, Durant ruptured an Achilles tendon. 
						
More recently Perkins took after Durant on Twitter, anointing Russell Westbrook as the greatest player ever to wear a Thunder uniform. The occasion was Westbrook’s first visit to Oklahoma City since he was dealt to the Houston Rockets last summer. 
Why the finger in Durant’s eye? It seems he disappointed Perkins for leaving the Thunder for the powerhouse Golden State Warriors once upon a time.

							googletag.cmd.push( function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-Outstream_Video""); } );
						}
					


Yea and our starting center @KendrickPerkins averaged a whopping 2 and 3 during that series. U played hard tho champ lol 
— Kevin Durant (@KDTrey5) January 10, 2020 

Anyway. 
Here it gets real. It seems Perkins, like all of us, has been shaken by the shocking death of Kobe Bryant, who, as far as we can tell, didn’t waste a day in his life. 

						if ( ""undefined"" !== typeof googletag ) {
							googletag.cmd.push( function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-Cube_Article""); } );
						}
					

Sunday, just hours after the tragedy, Perkins reached out to Durant. 

Just wanted to tell you I Love you my brother and whatever I did to hurt you I’m sorry bro and hope you forgive me!!! I love you bro real Talk! @KDTrey5

At 6-foot-10, Gallinari has the height to shoot over just about anyone, which is a weapon for him whether he's spacing the floor for guards or taking smaller opponents down to the low block. He is one of the league's masters of keeping defenders off-balance, which helps him supplement his scoring with trips to the line.",11
3213,"That last bit is important within a Philadelphia context.

He's also comfortable moving in and out of roles as the team needs — when Tobias Harris was traded by the Clippers last season, it was Gallinari who took on a larger share of responsibility to keep L.A. in the playoff mix.",12
3214,"He is not of the same caliber defensively, but he has made significant strides on that end as well, and his time under Doc Rivers forced Gallinari into an assortment of roles night-to-night.

He is certainly below Philadelphia's elite tier of defenders, but he is not a walking target waiting to be exploited.",13
3215,"And that brings us to price, which is the part of this exercise that brings this whole thing down.

The former is absolute lunacy, and the latter seems fairly unrealistic, as it doesn't do much for Oklahoma City and is a team-shifting trade for the Sixers. As much as Horford has looked old and bad at times for Philly, his acquisition was made with the Bucks on the brain, and swapping him out even for a very good player in Gallinari would bring a new set of questions to answer on their quest for a title.",15
3217,"In preliminary discussions leading into the deadline, my understanding is their focus has been on smaller, more realistic upgrades than a move of this sort, though it should be noted many of these discussions came before Josh Richardson's recent injury, whose severity is still unknown as of this writing.

3291,"The San Antonio Spurs will be back in action as they conclude the Rodeo Road Trip with a pair of games against the Utah Jazz and Oklahoma City Thunder. The Spurs went 1-1 last week, losing to the Denver Nuggets but beating the Thunder on the second night of a back-to-back. The Spurs are four and a half games behind the Memphis Grizzlies for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference.",4

3293,"The last time these teams faced off, the Spurs got the better of the Jazz in a 127-120 victory. Utah had a bad stretch where they lost five games in a row, but they have rebounded nicely with four straight wins and the Jazz are currently fourth in the Western Conference. Their schedule gets a little tougher with upcoming contests against the Houston Rockets and Boston Celtics after facing the Spurs. ",6
3294,"In what is shaping up to be one of the best moves of the season, the Jazz traded Dante Exum and some picks to the Cavs for Jordan Clarkson. Since the trade, Utah has had the best offensive rating in the NBA. While their defense has taken a bit of a hit (12th in defensive rating since the trade), there is no denying that their new Sixth Man of the Year candidate is a force to be reckoned with. ",7
3295,"The Spurs have faced Clarkson twice this season. He was a huge part in the Cleveland Cavaliers overtime win versus San Antonio, going 10-for-18 from the floor on his way to 31 points. Clarkson has shot a tidy 53.1% from the floor and averaged 22.5 points per game against the Spurs this season. Dejounte Murray has picked up his play on both ends of the floor recently but he, along Derrick White, will need to clamp down on Clarkson if the Spurs want to improve to 2-0 against Utah on the season. ",8
3296,"The Jazz are an impressive 20-5 at home. They have had the second best overall net rating since Clarkson’s arrival, just behind the Milwaukee Bucks. Very few teams have had success in Salt Lake City so the Spurs will need to dig deep as the Jazz will be looking to avenge their earlier loss to San Antonio. ",9
3297,"Last Meeting: Spurs 114, Thunder 106",10
3298,"After a fantastic performance in the All-Star game, Chris Paul and his Thunder teammates will look to right the ship after dropping two of their last three contests (including one against the Spurs). The Thunder are tied with the Dallas Mavericks for the sixth seed in the West — but OKC owns the tiebreaker. The Spurs were able to salvage some momentum by beating the Thunder before the All-Star break in Oklahoma City. Expect the Thunder to fight even harder to keep their hold on the sixth seed out West.",11
3299,"While the Spurs will need to keep close tabs on Paul and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, on the flip side they can exploit Danilo Gallinari, who is slow-footed and struggles to keep players in front of him. He only shot 4-for-16 in his most recent matchup against the Spurs and San Antonio should look to attack him whenever possible. ",12
3300,"In the last five minutes of close games, Gallinari shoots 42.3% from the floor — which isn’t terrible compared to his 44.2% field goal percentage on the season. However, once we get to three minutes left in a game that is within five points, his shooting plummets to 30.8%. While Gallinari is more than capable of hurting the Spurs with the ball in his hands, they will need to exploit him as often as they can on the other end. He is one of the few weak links in an otherwise solid defensive team. ",13

            Die Oklahoma City Thunder sind das Überraschungsteam der aktuellen NBA-Saison und übertreffen bislang alle Erwartungen. Die Gründe dafür sind vielfältig.
        ",1
3323,"Dass sich seine Oklahoma City Thunder nach etwas mehr als der Hälfte der Saison voll auf Playoff-Kurs befinden, hätte selbst Dennis Schröder so nicht für möglich gehalten.",2
3324,"Nicht wenige sahen nach dem ikonischen Gamewinner von Damian Lillard, von weit jenseits der Drei-Punkte-Linie, zum 4:1-Erfolg der Portland Trail Blazers in der ersten Playoff-Runde der vergangenen Spielzeit das Ende der erfolgreichen Dynastie der Thunder gekommen.",3
3325,Und tatsächlich leitete Paul George mit seinem Trade-Wunsch zu den Los Angeles Clippers nur wenige Wochen nach dem enttäuschenden Erstrunden-Aus den wohl härtesten Sommer seit Franchise-Gründung ein. (Spielplan der NBA),4
3326,"Denn nachdem seinem Wunsch entsprochen wurde, war klar, dass es für die Thunder extrem schwer werden würde, die Leistung aus den Jahren zuvor, bei denen man zumindest immer sicherer Playoff-Kandidat war, zu wiederholen. Schließlich zählt George zu den absoluten Superstars der Liga und war in der abgelaufenen Saison bis zu seiner Verletzung legitimer MVP-Kandidat. ",5

3328,"Doch damit nicht genug. Auch der andere Superstar des Teams, Russell Westbrook, wurde wenige Tage später im Tausch gegen Chris Paul zu den Houston Rockets getraded und Dennis Schröder stand auf einmal praktisch allein auf weiter Flur, kaum einer traute dem Deutschen zu, das Spiel seiner Mannschaft alleine an sich reißen zu können.",7
3329,Und so standen die Zeichen in der Chesapeake Arena fortan auf Rebuild. ,8
3330,"Ausgestattet mit Unmengen von Draft-Picks, die sich OKC-Manager Sam Presti unter anderem als Gegenwert für seine beiden Superstars ertauscht hatte, deutete alles auf einen Neuanfang in Oklahoma City hin.",9
3331,"In Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (SGA) kam ein vielversprechender junger Aufbau-Spieler von den Clippers, der dort in seiner Debüt-Saison schon sein immenses Potenzial angedeutet hatte. Zusammen mit Chris Paul, der im Tausch für Westbrook aus Houston kam, sollte er fortan den Back-Court bilden und von Großmeister Paul lernen um so zum neuen Franchise-Player der Thunder aufgebaut werden.",10
3332,"Schröder hatte hingegen kaum einer mehr auf dem Zettel, Gerüchte über einen Abschied des gebürtigen Braunschweigers nach nur einer Saison machten die Runde.",11
3333,Doch es sollte alles anders kommen.,12
3334,"Die Thunder stehen nach 45 gespielten Partien aktuell auf dem siebten Platz in der Western Conference, feierten zuletz drei Siege in Serie und liegend damit voll auf Playoff-Kurs. (Tabelle der NBA)",13
3335,Schröder hat daran großen Anteil. Zumeist von der Bank kommend dreht der 26-Jährige auf wie selten zuvor und spielt die vielleicht beste NBA-Saison seit seinem Wechsel zu den Atlanta Hawks im Jahr 2013. ,14
3336,"Durchschnittlich 18,6 Punkte und 3,8 Rebounds in 31 Minuten zaubert er aufs Parkett, lediglich seine 3,9 Assists bedeuten eine Verschlechterung im Vergleich zu früheren Jahren. Immer wieder wird er zum Top-Scorer, Game-Winner und ist damit für Coach Billy Donovan ein unverzichtbares Puzzle-Stück für den Erfolg der Thunder. Im Stile von Lou Williams könnte er als Bank-Scorer sogar zum Sixth Man des Jahres gewählt werden.",15
3337,Jetzt aktuelle NBA-Fanartikel kaufen - hier geht's zum Shop | ANZEIGE,16
3338,"Hinzu kommt, dass Chris Paul das Spiel denkt und lenkt wie zu seinen besten Zeiten bei den New Orleans Hornets oder den LA Clippers.

                            München -
            
            Die Oklahoma City Thunder sind das Überraschungsteam der aktuellen NBA-Saison und übertreffen bislang alle Erwartungen. Die Gründe dafür sind vielfältig.
        ",1
3347,"Dass sich seine Oklahoma City Thunder nach etwas mehr als der Hälfte der Saison voll auf Playoff-Kurs befinden, hätte selbst Dennis Schröder so nicht für möglich gehalten.",2
3348,"Nicht wenige sahen nach dem ikonischen Gamewinner von Damian Lillard, von weit jenseits der Drei-Punkte-Linie, zum 4:1-Erfolg der Portland Trail Blazers in der ersten Playoff-Runde der vergangenen Spielzeit das Ende der erfolgreichen Dynastie der Thunder gekommen.",3
3349,Und tatsächlich leitete Paul George mit seinem Trade-Wunsch zu den Los Angeles Clippers nur wenige Wochen nach dem enttäuschenden Erstrunden-Aus den wohl härtesten Sommer seit Franchise-Gründung ein. (Spielplan der NBA),4
3350,"Denn nachdem seinem Wunsch entsprochen wurde, war klar, dass es für die Thunder extrem schwer werden würde, die Leistung aus den Jahren zuvor, bei denen man zumindest immer sicherer Playoff-Kandidat war, zu wiederholen. Schließlich zählt George zu den absoluten Superstars der Liga und war in der abgelaufenen Saison bis zu seiner Verletzung legitimer MVP-Kandidat. ",5

3352,"Doch damit nicht genug. Auch der andere Superstar des Teams, Russell Westbrook, wurde wenige Tage später im Tausch gegen Chris Paul zu den Houston Rockets getraded und Dennis Schröder stand auf einmal praktisch allein auf weiter Flur, kaum einer traute dem Deutschen zu, das Spiel seiner Mannschaft alleine an sich reißen zu können.",7
3353,Und so standen die Zeichen in der Chesapeake Arena fortan auf Rebuild. ,8
3354,"Ausgestattet mit Unmengen von Draft-Picks, die sich OKC-Manager Sam Presti unter anderem als Gegenwert für seine beiden Superstars ertauscht hatte, deutete alles auf einen Neuanfang in Oklahoma City hin.",9
3355,"In Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (SGA) kam ein vielversprechender junger Aufbau-Spieler von den Clippers, der dort in seiner Debüt-Saison schon sein immenses Potenzial angedeutet hatte. Zusammen mit Chris Paul, der im Tausch für Westbrook aus Houston kam, sollte er fortan den Back-Court bilden und von Großmeister Paul lernen um so zum neuen Franchise-Player der Thunder aufgebaut werden.",10
3356,"Schröder hatte hingegen kaum einer mehr auf dem Zettel, Gerüchte über einen Abschied des gebürtigen Braunschweigers nach nur einer Saison machten die Runde.",11
3357,Doch es sollte alles anders kommen.,12
3358,"Die Thunder stehen nach 45 gespielten Partien aktuell auf dem siebten Platz in der Western Conference, feierten zuletz drei Siege in Serie und liegend damit voll auf Playoff-Kurs. (Tabelle der NBA)",13
3359,Schröder hat daran großen Anteil. Zumeist von der Bank kommend dreht der 26-Jährige auf wie selten zuvor und spielt die vielleicht beste NBA-Saison seit seinem Wechsel zu den Atlanta Hawks im Jahr 2013. ,14
3360,"Durchschnittlich 18,6 Punkte und 3,8 Rebounds in 31 Minuten zaubert er aufs Parkett, lediglich seine 3,9 Assists bedeuten eine Verschlechterung im Vergleich zu früheren Jahren. Immer wieder wird er zum Top-Scorer, Game-Winner und ist damit für Coach Billy Donovan ein unverzichtbares Puzzle-Stück für den Erfolg der Thunder. Im Stile von Lou Williams könnte er als Bank-Scorer sogar zum Sixth Man des Jahres gewählt werden.",15

3362,"Hinzu kommt, dass Chris Paul das Spiel denkt und lenkt wie zu seinen besten Zeiten bei den New Orleans Hornets oder den LA Clippers. Gilgeous-Alexander zeigte obendrein von Beginn an keinerlei Eingewöhnungsschwierigkeiten und ließ mit seinem jüngsten 20-20-10-Triple-Double gegen die Minnesota Timberwolves nicht nur All-Star-, sondern sogar Superstar-Potenzial aufblitzen.",17

AN OKLAHOMA CITY Police Department officer stood intently at the front of the large room. All eyes were locked at attention, waiting for his next command. He leaned forward, raised an eyebrow in each direction and exclaimed, “Go!”
 
A hush fell over the room as 25 kids began scrambling at their tables to assemble a tower of Jenga blocks with their group by using only one hand, their thumb and pointer finger. Sitting at one of the front tables was Thunder two-way guard, Luguentz Dort who oozed with the same fierce competitiveness he brings on the court. The past two rounds, Dort’s table had come in last place – this time, he meant business.
 
 
Suddenly, shouts erupted from one of the tables in the front as hands shot up signaling that the task was finally complete. The officer pointed in their direction and shouted, “First place!”
 
 
Relieved, Dort sat back in his chair and smiled after seeing that his group could rally back and work together to pull off a win. 
 
 
“Anytime you do something as a team, everything is just better,” said Dort.",2
3372,"
This was the theme of the day on Saturday – building together. Twenty-five members of the Oklahoma City Police Department’s F.A.C.T. Program were treated to a laid-back afternoon of fun at the Thunder Corporate Office. The Family Awareness and Community Teamwork program, also known as F.A.C.T. serves as a community outreach program led and run by the Oklahoma City Police Department where police officers dedicate time mentoring, empowering and inspiring youth ages 10 to 17. OKCPD is the only police department in the country with a full-time unit dedicated to such a program.
 
 
The afternoon included lunch, a tour of the offices, a Q&A with Dort and group activity which ultimately illustrated the power of teamwork and working in unity. Appropriately, each participant wore shirts with Unity printed boldly on the chest provided by the Thunder.
 
 
“We want the kids to recognize that one person is not an island by themselves and we’re better together,” said Lieutenant Wayland Cubit, the program’s founder and supervisor of 13 years. “The activity that we did today was just to show them that in the chaos of life, the main thing we want to do is try to connect to one another, look at each other’s gifts and talents and build something special together.”
 
 
After the chaos of the activity died down, the officer leading the activity returned to the front of the room and held up two blocks in the air.
 
 
“We have to make sure that in order for our city to be great, everyone brings their blocks to the table,” he said as he made eye contact with every member of the group. “You guys are going to have the blocks to build this city. I want to make sure you have the best blocks.”
 
 
The Thunder and Dort brought their blocks to the table that day as well. Together they helped to construct an impactful, memorable day for each of the potential-filled kids in the room.
 
 
“I hope it ushers in more hope and inspiration into the minds of our kids that if they work hard, if they keep doing what they’re doing, stay on the right track, there’s infinite long-term possibilities for their future that leads to success,” said Lt. Wayland.

3630,Basketball-Nationalspieler Dennis Schröder hat seine starke Form in der NBA bestätigt und Oklahoma City Thunder zum dritten Sieg nacheinander geführt.,5
3631,In der nordamerikanischen Profiliga kam der 26-Jährige am Mittwochabend (05.02.2020/Ortszeit) beim 109:103-Erfolg gegen die Cleveland Cavaliers auf 30 Punkte. Damit kam Schröder in den vergangenen acht Partien immer auf mindestens 20 Punkte. Dabei kam er sieben Mal von der Bank.,6
3632,"In der Schlussminute avancierte Schröder mit sechs Punkten zum Matchwinner. ""Er spielt auf einem sehr hohen Niveau und macht wirklich einen guten Job für uns"", lobte ihn sein Trainer Billy Donovan. OKC liegt in der Western Conference mit 31 Siegen und 20 Niederlagen auf Playoff-Kurs.",7

3635,"Die Personaldecke wurde noch dünner, als Kristaps Porzingis, der als bester Dallas-Schütze auf 32 Punkte kam, das Feld zeitweise verlassen musste.

Striding onto the floor at Wintrust Arena, Gilgeous-Alexander was a few steps ahead of his fellow 2020 Rising Stars teammates on the World squad as they assembled for practice early on Friday morning.

“It’s super cool to see how far Canadian basketball has come,” said Gilgeous-Alexander. 
		
At All-Star Weekend, the practices, the media sessions, they’re all build-up to the events at the NBA arena that evening. On Friday afternoon, Gilgeous-Alexander made an appearance at the ELeague All-Star Throwdown at the House of Blues, where he played NBA 2K while NBA TV commentators Quentin Richardson, Channing Frye, Ro Parrish and Kristin Ledlow looked on.

SGA kicked things off for the Thunder’s fully loaded weekend in the Rising Stars game. This is two consecutive seasons for Gilgeous-Alexander in this event, with the first coming last February in Charlotte when he played for the World Team as a rookie with the LA Clippers. This time around, he was a little more prepared for the whirlwind of events.
		
“It’s a little bit smoother. I know what to expect,” said Gilgeous-Alexander. “Even though it’s a little bit busier, I still know what’s coming.” 
		
Shai enjoyed connecting with guys around the league, the ones he competed against all season long but now got the chance to team up with even if just for a night. 
		
		
Making it two straight years and with his stock continuing to soar, Gilgeous-Alexander has the opportunity to start making it clear that he’ll be a household name, and a headliner at All-Star Weekend for years to come. 
		
“It’s one of those things you dream of as a kid,” said Gilgeous-Alexander. “I’m extremely excited. It’s an opportunity that not a lot of guys get to have. I’m just thankful for it.” 
		
As a four-star recruit, Gilgeous-Alexander was underrated coming out of high school but piqued the interest of University of Kentucky’s John Calipari. During his one year in Lexington, his rookie season in LA and now his first season with the Thunder, Gilgeous-Alexander has continually defied the prognosticators and improved his game. This season he’s averaging 19.5 points, 6.1 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 1.2 steals to earn his spot in the starting lineup for the World Team in the Rising Stars game. 
		
		
“My teammates and the (Thunder) organization does a really good job putting you in a position to succeed. It’s really been a blessed situation,” said Gilgeous-Alexander. 
		
After the pomp and circumstance of the team introductions, Gilgeous-Alexander got right to work, helping the world take a 39-30 lead through the first quarter. For his first basket, Gilgeous-Alexander drove right across the lane and finishes with a scooping righty layup off the glass, a quintessential SGA move. A few minutes later, Shai buried a left wing three, then on the next possession used some crafty dribbling skills to go behind his back, getting the ball to his left hand for another finger roll off the glass.

“I played last night, dunking wasn’t in it for me. Maybe next week,” Gilgeous-Alexander chuckled. 
		
		
After he checked back in for the second quarter, SGA received the ball on the block, turned around and used his length to rise over his defender and bank a shot in off the glass. Through the second and third quarters, Shai continued to be amongst the World Team’s scoring leaders, but the USA team surged ahead on the scoreboard to lead 115-105 after three quarters. Gilgeous-Alexander finished with 16 points on 7-of-15 shooting, 3 rebounds and 3 assists, but ultimately the USA squad won 151-131. 
		
Still, Gilgeous-Alexander had a blast playing in front of the fans in Chicago to kick off the NBA’s and shared the floor with his cousin Nickeil, a once in a lifetime experience. It’s also one Shai isn’t going to let Nickeil forget.  
		
		
“I left him a drop off in transition and he didn’t shoot it. I’m going to have to talk to him about that,” SGA grinned.

3745,"Tough Shooting Night Leads to Tough Loss 


By Paris Lawson | Digital Content Reporter | mailbag@okcthunder.com",2
3746,"Unlike its most recent games, the Thunder struggled shooting the ball. The squad scored fewer than 100 points for the first time in 15 games. On the other end, second chance points and easy looks at the rim propelled Dallas to a double-digit victory over the Thunder.
",3
3747,"In the first quarter, neither team shot over 40 percent from either the field or the 3-point line. It wasn’t until the second quarter that shots started falling, but they weren’t in the Thunder’s direction. All night, the Thunder struggled to knock down shots in the paint. In the first quarter alone, the Thunder shot only 4-12 in the lane and by the end of the night, 18 of 46.

“I think the first thing was we didn’t really have a very good offensive night shooting the ball, I think the last 10 games we’ve been really good and our offense has been from a ratings standpoint very high,” said Donovan. “You’re going to have nights like that, those things happen.”  

Meanwhile, although Dallas got off to a similar night shooting, in the second quarter they knocked down 5 of 8 from deep while racking in 12 points in the paint versus the Thunder’s six. This was the handiwork of Luka Doncic, Maxi Kleber and Jalen Brunson who all went perfect from 3-point land in the second quarter to help Dallas outscore OKC 34-25.

The Thunder shot out to an 11-0 run midway through the third quarter with the help of a couple of back-to-back 3-pointers to bring the Mavs lead down to five. 


However, while the Thunder was able to force missed shots on Dallas’s first attempts, the gave up second chance points from long rebounds. Shots like these sucked the life out of the Thunder who still struggled to maintain any type of rhythm on the offensive end.




“The bigger challenge for us was the second chance opportunities. I thought the long rebounds, the loose rebounds that they were able to come up with and get more possessions than us was critical,” said Thunder head coach Billy Donovan. “I think we were able to hang in there because I think our first shot defense was pretty good but I think the offensive rebounding was a huge differential in terms of point disparity.”

By the end of the night, the Thunder’s shooting clip from the field was only 39.5 percent from the field with Dennis Schröder leading the Thunder with 21 points seven rebounds and six assists.

“I think in the second half we defended better but still the second-chance points were pretty tough,” said Schröder. “We had a bad shooting night. It happens, but on defense we should have been locked in and getting stops but we didn’t do that tonight.”

As a response, Dallas emerged from the timeout with a play for a Luka Doncic 3-pointer at the top of the key which ignited an 8-0 Dallas run to bring the lead back to double digits forcing Billy Donovan to call a timeout of his own.

The Thunder pushed yet again, this time four different Thunder players put up a bucket while the Mavs were only able to muster one in a two-and-a-half-minute stretch. This once again brought the Dallas lead down to five, but it was short-lived as the Mavericks scrounged an offensive rebound and scored two of its 18 second chance points of the night. The Mavericks rolled with that momentum into the end of the quarter and finished with an 88-77 lead.

Early in the second quarter, Dennis Schröder orchestrated the break after a missed shot from Dallas on the other end sent the Thunder in transition with the advantage in numbers. Schröder halted on the right wing of the 3-point line with a defender right in front of him and reinforcements not far behind. Deonte Burton emerged at the top of the lane and Schröder motioned with his right hand for Burton to cut to the rim. When he did, Schröder hit Burton right around the free throw line.

Burton caught the ball, took two strides and elevated above the rim with commanding authority and threw down a reverberating left-handed slam that brought an audible “ooh” from the Chesapeake Energy Arena crowd.

The Thunder shot an uncharacteristic 18 of 49 in the paint. The offense generated looks that it gets nearly every night by moving the ball and getting high quality looks around the rim and making the extra pass around the perimeter.

By the end of the night, the Thunder racked up 23 assists on 34 makes as a result of that ball movement. However, several aggressive drives to the basket sucked in the help of surrounding defenders. Instead of spraying the ball out to the perimeter, it was a tough contested shot at the basket which didn’t go down on a lackluster shooting night like it was on Monday.

“We had some number of shots in the game with a number of possessions that probably were not great, but we had 23 assists on 39 percent shooting, so we tried to move the ball,” said Donovan. “I thought we had some pretty good looks on threes. I thought we tried to get into the paint and get and into the lane.”

3756,"The air hung heavy in Chesapeake Energy Arena in the wake of one of the most shocking and tragic losses the basketball world has seen. On Sunday, Laker legend and basketball icon, Kobe Bryant died in a helicopter crash that claimed the life of the eight other passengers on board including his 13-year-old daughter Gianna.

The shock of Sunday’s events was still fresh among players, coaches and fans alike. Individual tributes to Bryant could be seen at every turn. Fans wore his jersey in the stands. Players used their shoes as an homage to the legend either by wearing Kobe sneakers, rocking shoes that shimmered in gold, or bore heartfelt messages in permanent marker across the soles. For Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, it started when he walked into the arena with a yellow Lakers jersey peering from beneath his black, plaid coat. The number eight prominently displayed as he somberly walked through the hallway into the locker room.

“I just wanted to pay homage. He was a guy I looked up to growing up. A lot of guys that I know in the league also looked up to him. He has done wonderful things for the game, and wonderful things for me as a kid, so I just wanted to pay homage,” said the 21-year-old.

Just before tip-off, the lights dimmed in the arena with a picture of Bryant emblazoned on the jumbotron as a moment of silence was held before the national anthem. The tributes didn’t stop there. As the ball was tipped off, it landed it the hands of Luka Doncic in the backcourt who caught the ball and stood. Upon realizing the intended gesture of the Dallas guard, the Thunder faithful roared in approving applause and began to chant “KOBE” as the whistles blew to signal an eight-second backcourt violation. The Thunder then responded with a 24-second shot clock violation in the next possession. Twenty-four and eight ­– the two numbers hanging from the rafters in Staples Center in honor of the legendary career of Kobe Bryant.




“I’ll take that turnover for sure, anytime,” Schröder said postgame with a small grin. “It’s just to honor him, what he did for basketball, for the NBA. It’s just big, it’s not a problem for me and it felt good.”",13

“(Sunday) was just a sad day all the way around with the game losing just an iconic player, a true champion, a true competitor…” said Thunder head coach Billy Donovan.

Thunder forward Danilo Gallinari remembered specifically what Bryant meant to him as an Italian player. Bryant, who was raised in Italy and spoke fluent Italian would often speak to Gallinari during games in Italian as they competed against each other. Internationally, Gallinari experienced first-hand just how broad Bryant’s legacy reached. In his camp that the holds every summer in Italy, Gallinari can always count on a few campers repping his own jersey, but always sees much more in Kobe jerseys.

“It was just very tough to process, it still is,” said Gallinari. “I had only good memories about him on and off the court, especially with him having such a great relationship with my country, with Italy.”

With an impact that transcended basketball, sports and team affiliation, Bryant’s lasting legacy could be felt through every notion, play and tribute. A life and career that was bigger than basketball.

“A huge impact. The NBA is what it is right now mostly because of him. What he did, they way that he approached the game and the way that he approached his job I think is something that every young player should learn from and every young player should get is as an example,” said Gallinari. “So, it’s really tough to process and to talk about it is still shocking.”

3765,"Tough Shooting Night Leads to Tough Loss 


By Paris Lawson | Digital Content Reporter | mailbag@okcthunder.com",2
3766,"Unlike its most recent games, the Thunder struggled shooting the ball. The squad scored fewer than 100 points for the first time in 15 games. On the other end, second chance points and easy looks at the rim propelled Dallas to a double-digit victory over the Thunder.
",3
3767,"In the first quarter, neither team shot over 40 percent from either the field or the 3-point line. It wasn’t until the second quarter that shots started falling, but they weren’t in the Thunder’s direction. All night, the Thunder struggled to knock down shots in the paint. In the first quarter alone, the Thunder shot only 4-12 in the lane and by the end of the night, 18 of 46.

“I think the first thing was we didn’t really have a very good offensive night shooting the ball, I think the last 10 games we’ve been really good and our offense has been from a ratings standpoint very high,” said Donovan. “You’re going to have nights like that, those things happen.”  

Meanwhile, although Dallas got off to a similar night shooting, in the second quarter they knocked down 5 of 8 from deep while racking in 12 points in the paint versus the Thunder’s six. This was the handiwork of Luka Doncic, Maxi Kleber and Jalen Brunson who all went perfect from 3-point land in the second quarter to help Dallas outscore OKC 34-25.

The Thunder shot out to an 11-0 run midway through the third quarter with the help of a couple of back-to-back 3-pointers to bring the Mavs lead down to five. 


However, while the Thunder was able to force missed shots on Dallas’s first attempts, the gave up second chance points from long rebounds. Shots like these sucked the life out of the Thunder who still struggled to maintain any type of rhythm on the offensive end.

Griffin underwent knee surgery on January 7 and is out indefinitely. The Pistons received a disabled player exception for him on January 22 so his season could be over. Kennard is also out with a knee injury and may not return until after the All-Star break. That has allocated more minutes to Christian Wood (10.5 points, 5.3 boards), Bruce Brown and Svi Mykhailiuk to give them a chance to step up.

4141,"Oklahoma City was quiet at the deadline as a potential deal that could have sent Gallinari to Miami never panned out. That might be a good thing for the Thunder, who has pushed their way into the Northwest Division race as they are in striking distance of the Nuggets. Detroit just dealt away one of their top options in Drummond for basically pennies on the dollar. The Pistons may have been waving the white flag with that trade as the return on investment didn’t move the needle. Oklahoma City is the better team right now and that, plus playing at home, gives them the upper hand here.",22
